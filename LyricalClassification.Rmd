## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
newdataset <- read.csv("/Users/pnk2304/PycharmProjects/SongRecommender/Mining/SongRecommender/analyzed.csv", TRUE)
```

```{r}
positiveRatings <- newdataset$Pos
negativeRatings <- newdataset$Neg
neutralRatings <- newdataset$Ntr

df <- data.frame(positiveRatings, negativeRatings, neutralRatings)
```
