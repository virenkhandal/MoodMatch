Stuck With U,Ariana Grande & Justin Bieber,"[Intro: Ariana Grande]
Mmm
Hey, yeah
(That's just for fun)
(What?)
(I'm stuck with you)
Ah

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
I'm not one to stick around
One strike and you're out, baby
Don't care if I sound crazy
But you never let me down, no, no
That's why when the sun's up, I'm stayin'
Still layin' in your bed, singin'

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Got all this time on my hands
Might as well cancel our plans, yeah
I could stay here for a lifetime

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
So, lock the door and throw out the key
Can't fight this no more, it's just you and me
And there's nothin' I, nothin' I, I can do
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
So, go ahead and drive me insane
Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldn't change
Being stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you, baby

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber with Ariana Grande]
There's nowhere we need to be, no, no, no
I'ma get to know you better
Kinda hope we're here forever
There's nobody on these streets
If you told me that the world's endin'
Ain't no other way that I can spend it

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber, with Ariana Grande & Both]
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Ooh)
Got all this time in my hands
Might as well cancel our plans (Yeah, yeah)
I could stay here forever

[Chorus: Justin Bieber with Ariana Grande]
So, lock the door and throw out the key
Can't fight this no more, it's just you and me
And there's nothin' I, nothin' I, I can do
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
So, go ahead and drive me insane
Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldn't change
Being stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you

[Bridge: Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande & Both]
Woah
Baby, come take all my time
Go on, make me lose my mind
We got all that we need here tonight

[Chorus: Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber & Both]
I lock the door (Lock the door) and throw out the key
Can't fight this no more (Can't fight this no more), it's just you and me
And there's nothin' I, nothin' I'd rather do
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
So, go ahead and drive me insane
Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldn't change
All this lovin' you, hatin' you, wantin' you
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with
You, oh, oh

Stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you"
Say So,Doja Cat Featuring Nicki Minaj,"[Letra de ""Doja Cat - Say So (Remix) ft. Nicki Minaj (Traducción al Español)""]

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Sí, lo sabes
Mmm, este el remix
Doja, rrr

[Coro: Doja Cat & Nicki Minaj]
Del día a la noche a la mañana, quédate conmigo en el momento
Te lo habría dicho si lo supiera, ¿por qué no lo dices?
Ni siquiera me di cuenta, no hay que adaptarse
Tienes que mantenerme concentrada; ¿lo quieres? Dilo (Ah)

[Verso 1: Nicki Minaj]
Cada vez que me tomo un descanso, el juego después es aburrido
Hermosa como Naomi, Cassie, más Lauren
Rapeo como Weezy, Foxy, más Lauryn
Rebota como Rams, mira, ahora ese es Gordon
No entienden que la bolsa está hablando, soy extranjera
Cuando piensan que superarán a la reina, comienzan a caer
Palabras a mis tiros de culo soy tan descarada
Los tengo tratando de golpear mi trasero como la joven Keke
Sí, soy ghetto, palabras para Gepetto
Además, soy pequeña, ¿dónde están mis zapatos?
Dile a Mike Jordan, envíame mis Retros
Solía ​​ser bi, pero ahora solo soy hetero
No estoy hablando de medicina, pero lo hice morfina
Desde que puse mi vagina en cuarentena
Él conoce esta cosa ""A1"" como un delito grave
Todo lo que tiene que hacer es decir la palabra como un concurso de ortografía

[Coro: Doja Cat]
Del día a la noche a la mañana, quédate conmigo en el momento
Te lo habría dicho si lo supiera, ¿por qué no lo dices?
Ni siquiera me di cuenta, no hay que adaptarse
Tienes que mantenerme concentrada; ¿lo quieres? Dilo (Sí)

[Verso 2: Doja Cat]
Déjame chequear mi pecho, mi respiración, un segundo (Ja)
Él nunca había visto un vestido así (Ah)
Él nunca se había impresionado así
Es probablemente porqué se quedó callado toda la noche como zip
Lo quiero, lo amo, lo necesito, mucho
Lo llevo, lo adueño, lo robo, rápido
Chico, deja de jugar, agárrame el culo
¿Por qué estás tan tímido? (Caliente)
Calla, quédatelo, continúa
¿Por qué no eres directo?
Sabiendo que quieres esta mujer
No lo niegues hasta que pruebes (Sí, sí)
Todas estas perras odiando porque te tengo conmigo
Todos mis negros dicen que estás muy comprometido
Más auténtica que las que tuviste, y linda
Todo lo del cuerpo-erpo, el culo y las tetas

[Coro: Doja Cat]
Del día a la noche a la mañana, quédate conmigo en el momento
Te lo habría dicho si lo supiera, ¿por qué no lo dices?
Ni siquiera me di cuenta, no hay necesidad de adaptarse
Tienes que mantenerme concentrada; ¿lo quieres? Dilo
Del día a la noche a la mañana, quédate conmigo en el momento
Te lo habría dicho si lo supiera, ¿por qué no lo dices?
Ni siquiera me di cuenta, no hay necesidad de adaptarse
Tienes que mantenerme concentrada; ¿lo quieres? Dilo

[Post-Coro: Doja Cat & Nicki Minaj]
Mmm-mmm, ajá, ah (Sí, lo sabes)
Ajá, ajá, ajá (Sí, lo sabes)
Mmm-mmm, ajá, ah (Sí, lo sabes)
Ajá, ajá, ajá (Sí, lo sabes)

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
Podrías haberlo dicho
Chico, deberías haberlo dicho
Dilo, dilo
Me vestí solo para sentarme en la casa
Las personas que menos hacen siempre hacen más
Estoy contando dinero mientras él me chupa los dedos de los pies
Realmente sucio con esas bolas, todo neto, sí, soy asquerosa
¿Por qué estás hablando de quién es el cuerpo falso?
Con todos los rellenos en tu cara, estás llena de odio
Ese verdadero culo no mantendrá a tu negro en casa
Ahora te ves tonta, esa es la palabra de silicona"
Gooba,6ix9ine,"[Chorus]
I tell a nigga don't dick ride, don't blick ride
Leave it to the double thick thighs, twin sisters
Drop it down and wobble, wobble up, mami booted up
She get down and gobble, gobble up 'cause my money up
Slide, slide in the Bentley truck-a, the Wraith truck-a
Your bestie is a dick sucker, I big dub her
As-salama-lama alaykum, you big hater
You nothin' but a hater, hater, clout chaser

[Verse 1]
Now we catch him at the chicken spot, up a couple chops
Pop that nigga with a hundred shots, ra-ta-ta-ta-ta
DayDay made that nigga Diddy Bop, cha-cha-cha-cha-cha
He thought we was gon' knuckle up, bitch, I don't box
And these niggas always talkin' shit, yadda-yadda-ya
When you see me, what you talkin' 'bout, fuck you talkin' 'bout?
Niggas always wanna chase clout, bitch, I am clout
Tell 'em get up out my face now 'fore I grrt
Are you dumb, stupid, or dumb, huh?
Play me like a dummy, like bitch, are you dumb?
Are you dumb, stupid, or dumb, huh?
Yeah, you got some money, but you still fuckin' ugly
Stupid, listen
When I talk, you better listen
We can make him dance, bachata
Slide over, do the cha-cha
Grrt, bah-bah
Make a nigga go adios
Dímelo, mami
Fresca, you nasty
Flame up, light it
They see me and get excited

They sick, been hot way before Coronavirus
Nigga, who did that? Nigga, who did what?
Nigga, that's my shit, don't bite it

[Chorus]
I tell a nigga don't dick ride, don't blick ride
Leave it to the double thick thighs, twin sisters
Drop it down and wobble, wobble up, mami booted up
She get down and gobble, gobble up 'cause my money up
Slide, slide in the Bentley truck-a, the Wraith truck-a
Your bestie is a dick sucker, I big dub her
As-salama-lama alaykum, you big hater
You nothin' but a hater, hater, clout chaser

[Verse 2]
You're mad I'm back, big mad
He's mad, she's mad, big sad
Haha, don't care, stay mad
Ah-hah, ah-hah, ah-hah
Haha, bitch, I'm laughin' 'cause you big mad
See it in your face, cry baby, bitch, you big sad
Niggas tweetin' bout me, got me trendin', bitch, you big sad
Tell me how I ratted, came home to a big bag

I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote-oh-oh-oh

I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Verse 2]
Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Bridge]
Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me, what you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
It's only me, let it go

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away"

Someone You Loved,Lewis Capaldi,"[Verse 1]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug

If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you

If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear

If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?"

Chasin' You,Morgan Wallen,"[Verse 1]
We used to chase that Chattanooga freight
Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long til I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then

[Chorus]
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you

[Verse 2]
You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as Guitar Town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know
Well you should know that I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio

Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town

Still chasing you, still chasing you"
Falling,Trevor Daniel,"[Intro]
Oh
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything

[Verse]
Talk to me, I need to hear you need me like I need ya
Fall for me, I wanna know you feel how I feel for you, love
Before you, baby, I was numb, drown out pain by pourin' up
Speedin' fast on the run, never wanna get caught up
Now you're the one that I'm callin'
Swore I thought I'd never fall again, don't think I'm just talkin'
I think I might go all in, no exceptions, girl, I need ya

[Bridge]
Feeling like I'm out of my mind, 'cause I can't get enough
Only one that I give my time, 'cause I got eyes for ya
Might make an exception for ya, 'cause I been feelin' ya
Think I might be out of my mind, I think that you're the one

[Chorus]
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything

[Outro]
Will never give my all again
'Cause I'm sick of falling down
When I open up and give my trust
They find a way to break it down
Break down
Tear me up inside
When you break me down"
I Hope,Gabby Barrett,"[Verse 1]
I, I hope she makes you smile
The way you made me smile on the other end of a phone
In the middle of a highway driving alone
Oh baby I, I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along and gets you thinking about her
Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah

[Chorus]
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me

[Verse 2]
Yeah then I hope she shows up in a 2 am pic from her friend
Hanging on to a guy and you just ain't him
I hope you stay up all night all alone waiting by the phone
And then she calls
And baby I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget and take her on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss

[Chorus]
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me

[Bridge]
I hope what goes comes all the way around
I hope she makes you feel the same way
About her that I feel about you right now

[Chorus]
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
Like you did on me"

You know I like when you ride at the top, bae

[Verse 1]
She want Chane'-ne' and Dio'-o'
I'm only doin' cash out, I don't need promo
I pull up to the high rise, I'm in the four-four
Inside cocoa
If I got a feeling, I keep it inside my heart
And I keep a Patek, too, 'cause I don't do facades
You see my diamonds even when I'm in the dark
And since you got it, it make you go and do anything you want to

If she got a best friend with her, take her back to my loft
Got her five in the mornin', wildin', wildin'
And her name ain't Megan but she a stallion, stallion
Never keep my hoes divided, 'member I was pullin' up in the valley
And you know I take her soul when she ridin'

Death Bed,Powfu Featuring beabadoobee,"[Intro: beabadoobee]
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

[Verse 1: Powfu]
Yeah, I don't wanna fall asleep, I don't wanna pass away
I been thinking of our future 'cause I'll never see those days
I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect
I been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health
When I leave this earth, hopin' you'll find someone else
'Cause yeah, we still young, there's so much we haven't done
Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son
I wish it could be me, but I won't make it out this bed
I hope I go to heaven so I see you once again
My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings
Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending

[Chorus: beabadoobee, Powfu, beabadoobee & Powfu]
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed (Yeah, ayy)
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed (Ayy, yeah)

[Verse 2: Powfu]
I'm happy that you here with me, I'm sorry if I tear up
When me and you were younger, you would always make me cheer up
Taking goofy videos and walking through the park
You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets, sing me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03
Sundays, went to church, on Mondays, watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me

[Chorus: beabadoobee, Powfu, beabadoobee & Powfu]
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

[Outro: beabadoobee]
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed"
Does To Me,Luke Combs Featuring Eric Church,"[Verse 1: Luke Combs]
I was a third-string dreamer on a second-place team
But I was hell on wheels with a full head of steam
When coach put me in
And I'm still proud of that hit
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week
No, I didn't get lucky
But I still felt like a king
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Verse 2: Luke Combs]
I was the one phone call when my brother went to jail
Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail
No, I'll never get it back
But I'm okay with that
I was the first man standing next to my best friend
The day the love of his life said ""I do"" to him
I was a couple beers deep
But I still remembered that speech
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Bridge: Eric Church]
There's a worn-out blade that my granddaddy gave me
My mama's first Bible, Daddy's Don Williams vinyl
That first-fish-catching Zebco thirty-three
Well, that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Chorus: Luke Combs & Eric Church]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving average Joe (Average Joe)
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And I'm a damn hard working
One thing's for certain
I stand up for what I believe (For what I believe)
That might not mean much to you
But it does to me
Yeah, it does to me
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Outro: Eric Church]
Oh, it does to me
Oh man, it does to me"
Sunday Best,Surfaces,"[Intro: Forrest]
Good, feeling good

[Chorus: Forrest]
Ayy, feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best (Yeah, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 1: Forrest]
Every day can be a better day, despite the challenge
All you gotta do is leave it better than you found it
It's gonna get difficult to stand, but hold your balance
I just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it 'cause

[Pre-Chorus: Forrest]
Everyone falls down sometimes
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
It's okay, uh-huh-huh, uh
It's okay, it's okay

[Chorus: Forrest]
Ayy, feeling good like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best (Ayy)

[Verse 2: Forrest]
Some days you wake up and nothing works, you feel surrounded
Gotta give your feet some gravity to get you grounded
Keep good things inside your ears just like the waves and sound did
And just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it

[Pre-Chorus: Forrest]
Everyone falls down sometimes
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
It's okay, uh-huh-huh, uh
It's okay, it's okay

[Chorus: Forrest]
Ayy, feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best
Ayy, feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best"

Break My Heart,Dua Lipa,"[Verse 1]
I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?

[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

[Verse 2]
I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me

[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home (I would've stayed at home 'cause I–)
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

[Bridge]
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home (I would've stayed at home 'cause I–)
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no (Oh no), I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?"
Whats Poppin,Jack Harlow,"[Chorus]
What's poppin'? (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
Brand new whip just hopped in (Just hopped in)
I got options (Oh Lord, Jetson made another one)
I could pass that bitch like Stockton (It ain't nothin')
Just joshin'
I'ma spend this holiday locked in (Ooh)
My body got rid of them toxins (Mmh, mmh)
SportsCenter, top ten

[Verse]
I could put the ball in the end zone, put a bad bitch in the friendzone, ooh
This shit sound like an intro, Jetson, give me that tempo, ooh
Told Pooh he a fool with this shit (He a fool)
Told her don't let her friends know (Don't)
In the 'Ville and I move like a don (Don)
Eating fettuccine at Vincenzo's
Me and my 'migos got that free smoke
On the West Coast, yeah, I'm talking 'bout pre-rolls (Pre-roll)
Dark haired bitch and she look like Shego (She do)
Hometown hero, feeling myself, can't murder my ego (Can't do it)
She heard of my deep stroke
She said, ""Babe, does it hurt when I deep throat?"" (It does)
Certified freak ho
Hang around us and she learnin' my lingo
Back then, wasn't worried 'bout me though
In the gym tryna work on my free throw
Goddamn
Spending money at the club like Sam's (Cha-ching)
Yes, ma'am
She a lil' freak on cam
But she don't put this on the 'Gram (Nah)
Lil' boys tryna diss on the 'Gram (Ayy)
I can't switch on the fam (Bitch)
Shit's hot, hit the switch on the fan (Hit that shit)
This where my head is (Listen)
I feel resentment from every direction
Even some homies be wearing expressions
I be discouraged from sharing my blessings (Damn)
We used to share a connection
Now it just feels like it's wearing and stretching
I'm getting real sick of taking advice
From people that never could stare at reflections (Ooh)
Somewhere in there is a lesson
Y'all ain't evolvin', it's very depressing
I'm at the club with the basketball team
Me and the Cardinals are sharing a section (Facts)
Gotta cherish the present
I'm drinking water and wearing protection
Got a career and I'm very invested
Some people call it a scary obsession (Ooh, period, but)
I like to call it a passion, I can't be sitting relaxin' (Nah, I can't)
PG, we getting some traction, I'm at the venue, it's packed in (Packed out)
I'm digging her accent
I got a B.B. Simon belt on me and she tryna get it unfastened
That's my type of distraction, that's my type and she Latin (That's facts, ooh)
Got my own flow and I'm 'bout to get a patent
Brand new sheets for the bed, they satin (Soft, real soft)
Y'all wasn't tuned in back then (Nah)
My swag, they keep jackin' (Keep on jackin')
I ain't doin' no verse, quit askin' (Quit askin')

[Chorus]
What's poppin'? (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
Brand new whip just hopped in (Just hopped in)
I got options
I could pass that bitch like Stockton (It ain't nothin')
Just joshin'
I'ma spend this holiday locked in (Ooh)
My body got rid of them toxins (Mmh, mmh)
SportsCenter, top ten"
Be Kind,Marshmello & Halsey,"[Verse 1: Halsey]
Wanna believe, wanna believe
That you don't have a bad bone in your body
But the bruises on your ego make you go wild, wild, wild, yeah
Wanna believe, wanna believe
That even when you're stone cold, you're sorry
Tell me why you gotta be so outta your mind, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
I know you're chokin' on your fears
Already told you I'm right here
I will stay by your side every night

[Chorus: Halsey]
I don't know why you hide from the one
And close your eyes to the one
Mess up and lie to the one that you love
When you know you can cry to the one
Always confide in the one
You can be kind to the one that you love
Ah

[Verse 2: Halsey]
I know you need, I know you need
The upper hand even when we aren't fighting
'Cause in the past, you had to prepare every time, yeah
Don't wanna leave, don't wanna leave
But if you're gonna fight, then do it for me
I know you're built to love, but broken now, so just try, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
I know you're chokin' on your fears
Already told you I'm right here
I will stay by your side every night

[Chorus: Halsey]
I don't know why you hide from the one
And close your eyes to the one
Mess up and lie to the one that you love
When you know you can cry to the one
Always confide in the one
You can be kind to the one that you love
Ah

[Bridge: Halsey]
I know it's hard for you, but it's not fair
Going sick in the head, tryna get you there
And I know it's hard for you, but it's not fair
It's not fair

[Chorus: Halsey]
I don't know why you hide from the one
And close your eyes to the one
Mess up and lie to the one that you love
When you know you can cry to the one
Always confide in the one
You can be kind to the one that you love
Ah, ah
When you know you can cry to the one
Always confide in the one
You can be kind to the one that you love
Ah"
I Hope You're Happy Now,Carly Pearce & Lee Brice,"[Verse 1: Carly Pearce with Lee Brice]
It's all on me, it's my mistake
I said ""I don't love you"" a little too late
But I guess there ain't ever a right time
And I don't know why it's called a goodbye
Go run my name into the ground
Tell everyone you know just how
How I slammed the door on our forever
But I promise you it's for the better

[Chorus: Carly Pearce & Lee Brice]
I hope you find what you were looking for
I hope your heart ain't hurting anymore
And you get moving on, all figured out
And you don't hate me somehow
'Cause I hope you're happy now

[Verse 2: Lee Brice with Carly Pearce]
Who knew this heart could break this hard
Or a love like ours could fall apart
Without so much as a warning
I thought that I was what you wanted

[Chorus: Lee Brice & Carly Pearce, Lee Brice]
Well I guess you found what you were looking for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothing left
And so I hope you're happy now

[Chorus: Carly Pearce & Lee Brice, Carly Pearce]
I hope you find what you were looking for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
Hope you get moving on, all figured out
And you don't hate me somehow
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothing left
So I hope you're happy now

Happy now
Oh, I hope you're happy now

Beer Can't Fix,Thomas Rhett Featuring Jon Pardi,"[Verse 1: Thomas Rhett]
You're all alone at a party, you wanna dance with somebody
But you ain't got a clue how to ask
You and your girl had a fight and now she's sayin' goodbye
She ran upstairs and packed her bags

[Pre-Chorus: Thomas Rhett]
It could be rainin' on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed about your work situation
Ain't gotta listen to me, but all I'm sayin'

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett]
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't no pain it can't wash away
From the moment that it hits your lips
Makes those clouds look a little less gray
Oh, you could be lonely, or heartbroken
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown into a smile real quick
There ain't nothing that a beer can't fix

[Verse 2: Jon Pardi]
You're on a lake and you're fishin'
It's hot and all that you're gettin' is a little nibble here and there
You're sitttin', watchin' your team losin' that championship ring
And you're feelin like life ain't fair

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Pardi]
It could be rainin' on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed about your work situation

[Chorus: Jon Pardi]
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't no pain, it can't wash away
From the moment that it hits your lips
Makes those clouds look a little less gray
Oh, you could be lonely, heartbroken
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown into a smile real quick
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix (Yeehaw)

[Bridge: Thomas Rhett & Jon Pardi]
It could be rainin' on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed about your work situation
Ain't gotta save it for no special occasion

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett, Jon Pardi & Both]
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't no pain, it can't wash away, no
From the moment that it hits your lips
Makes those clouds look a little less gray
Oh, you could be lonely (Lonely)
Heartbroken (Heartbroken)
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown into a smile real quick (So quick)
It might take one or it might take six
Drink it down, it will do the trick
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix"
Before You Go,Lewis Capaldi,"[Verse 1]
I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say

[Pre-Chorus]
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

[Chorus]
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

[Verse 2]
Was never the right time, whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

[Pre-Chorus]
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

[Chorus]
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

[Bridge]
Would we be better off by now
If I'd have let my walls come down?
Maybe, I guess we'll never know
You know, you know

[Chorus]
Before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go"
After A Few,Travis Denning,"[Verse 1]
I probably shouldn't have said hello
When I saw you out with your friends
I know I should've left it alone
When I caught you looking

[Pre-Chorus]
A little smile, a little how you been
A little touch, a little reminisce
It always starts off innocent

[Chorus]
But after a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh, after a few

[Verse 2]
We always take it way too far
Where it's too much to resist
We always make it way too hard
To walk away after that third kiss

[Pre Chorus 2]
We pretend that we'll be fine
Through the sting of the morning light
'Cause it happens every time

[Chorus]
After a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh yeah, after a few

[Bridge]
Little smile, little how you been
Little touch, little reminisce
We both know how it ends

[Chorus]
After a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do

I loathe romancing in itself, yeah, I'd be damned to try

Look, uh, look

[Chorus]
Heart been broke so many times I don't know what to believe
Mama say it’s my fault, it's my fault, I wear my heart on my sleeve
Think it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice ’cause I can't breathe
I'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice, it's gettin' the best of me

[Verse]
While in the cell with Lil' Hakeem, after I slapped him I had told him
""I don't know how you get down with them clowns but I'm a soldier""
No one could understand, I had way too much aggression
That built over the years from my abandoned adolescence
See I done been lied to, backstabbed, and heartbroken
I wanted to cry but I was too afraid to open
Prayin’ one day I’d find a peace of mind by the ocean
I spent all my time committing crimes to get closer
While at my nana house I play the couch, starin' at the ceiling
Tryin’ not to get in my feelings
Thinkin' of a way I could make these millions
Maybe that'll take this pain away and clear up all these rainy days, yeah

[Chorus]
Heart been broke so many times I don't know what to believe
Mama say it’s my fault, it's my fault, I wear my heart on my sleeve
Think it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice 'cause I can't breathe
I'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice, it's gettin' the best of me

All this designer on my body got me drip, drip, ayy
Straight up out the Yajects, I'm a big Crip
If I got a pint of lean, I'ma sip, sip
I run the racks up with my queen like London and Nip
But I got rich on all these niggas, I didn't forget, back
I had to go through the struggle, I didn't forget that
I hopped inside of the Maybach and now I can sit back
These bitches know me now 'cause I got them big racks
'Cause I'm gettin' money now, I know you heard that
Young nigga on the corner, bitch, I had to serve crack
Uncle fronted me some P's, had to get them birds back
We came up on dirty money, I gave it a birdbath

Got a New Orleans bitch and man, that pussy voodoo
And I'm that nigga now, who knew?

(Aviator)

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
These ain't no Guess jeans
I dropped out of school, I'm still good at math, but, nigga, don't test me
I played to the left, they went to the right, they tried to finesse me
Still riding 'round with that blicky, I hope they don't catch me
Police had raided our spot, so we went to the next street
Play like I'm dumb, as soon as it pop, I'm goin' retarded
He say I'm hard and he say I'm garbage, I'm rich regardless
We in Miami in the middle of the winter, and we on them jet skis
If we in Atlanta, I'm runnin' the 'Cat and I'm workin' the red key

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
I cannot mention my homies inside of my song 'cause I know they be trappin' a lot
I can't keep takin' these pills, when I'm in the trenches, they say I be cappin' a lot
I know a nigga who say he got rich off the dope, but I know he be actin' a lot
I know some niggas who said that they took down the city, but niggas be lackin' a lot
Yeah
That shit was awful, nigga had that dog food
That day they shot you, I slid on a Mongoose
You cannot come back around me, you turned your back on me, I cannot forget
The police was lyin', they say that they caught you, but nigga, they made you admit
Your name was found, you put in that work, they took your stick, you a bitch
Fuck my opps, they be on my dick, they all be mad we rich (Turn up)

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Only twenty-five, livin' like a boss, ridin' 'round with a chauffeur
I don't sell drugs, still be paranoid, keep lookin' over my shoulder
Niggas lyin' like I'm stealin' swag, boy, that's my shit like I wrote it

[Verse 3: Polo G]
Uh
These rappers really nice as hell
I'm a different nigga when I'm pissed off
Man, he say he gon' press up on who?
I'ma get the steel like I'm Chris Paul
Back to back suburbans, I'm a big dawg
I was in the slums servin' Fentanyl
Zombieland, junkies havin' withdrawals
I been gettin' to it, lotta missed calls
Turn it off, what the fuck is he talking 'bout?
I should slap you for sayin' he hot as me
I don't know who could fuck with me honestly
They know I'm the man, so they watchin' me
Different color bands like Monopoly
Man, he must not be usin' his head
If he thinkin' I don't keep a Glock with me
That's like suicide if you play with us
Got a better chance at the lottery
Call an ambulance when that chopper sweep
Make the crowd dance, choreography
Once I got a plan, ain't no stoppin' me
Three-car garage, million-dollar crib
With a foreign bitch ridin' on top of me
Lot of people done said I wouldn't be shit
Well, I guess they owe me an apology

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
These ain't no Guess jeans
I dropped out of school, I'm still good at math, but, nigga, don't test me
I played to the left, they went to the right, they tried to finesse me
Still riding 'round with that blicky, I hope they don't catch me

I smell your perfume in crowds
I swear your number's all my phone wants to call

It's kinda funny how I can't seem
To get away from you
It's almost like you don't want me to

You've got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey, but I got no proof
That you showed up tonight
In that dress just to mess with my head
So much for so long
Out of sight, out of mind
Girl, you're lookin' so good
It's drivin' me out of mine
Oh, you're breakin' my heart
Baby, you're playin' hard to forget

[Verse 2]
Told me to leave all your things
Out on the porch, on the swing
You'd come and grab 'em by the end of the week
Well, it's just some jeans and a shirt
But it's a whole lot of hurt
I think I know why you've been dragging your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't it funny how I can't seem
To get away from you?
It's almost like you don't want me to

You've got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey, but I got no proof
That you showed up tonight
In that dress just to mess with my head

It's drivin' me out of mine
Oh, you're breakin' my heart

City to city, got girls goin' wild
Better not reach for my chain when I jump in the crowd
Lambo' so low, gotta squat

They know I'm runnin' it right to the bank
They want me to ease up, I didn't leave 'em any breathin' room, sorry, I told 'em, ""I can't""
Heard you a rat, so you know what's gon' happen whenever we catch you, I run with them snakes

They say you too piped up, but I think that I love you
Lil' mama a party girl, she just wan' have fun too
They say you ain't wifey type, but I don't care, I want you
She like to do drugs too, she in love with guns too
They say you too piped up, but I think that I love you

[Verse]
She don't want nobody, she don't need somebody
I'm tryna be with you so you don't be without me
She totin' just like me, no, we can't leave without it
She boot up off the meds like she can't breathe without it
She drinkin' Four Lokos, I can't get with those
She wan' give me toto, I tell her come close
She say, ""You say you love me, but I don't know what love means""
I ask her who got her heart, 'cause damn, that nigga lucky
I been tryna reach for it, but it's too far above me
I ain't never do you wrong, so tell me why you don't trust me
She don't do this often, she said it's only because me
You the one who want it, therefore you can never judge me
She just wanna party and nothing's wrong with that
Every time I'm calling, she say she gon' call me back
I told her call me Rocky, she say she not gon' call me that
You say you come with a lot, well, baby, I want all of that

[Chorus]
Lil' mama a party girl, she just wan' have fun too
They say you ain't wifey type, but I don't care, I want you
She like to do drugs too, she in love with guns too
They say you too piped up, but I think that I love you
Lil' mama a party girl, she just wan' have fun too
They say you ain't wifey type, but I don't care, I want you
She like to do drugs too, she in love with guns too
They say you too piped up, but I think that I love you

All white Gucci suit, I'm feeling righteous, yeah
I know that the truth is hard to digest, yeah
Five or six pills in my right hand, yeah
Codeine runneth over on my nightstand
Takin' medicine to fix all of the damage
My anxiety the size of a planet (Yeah, ooh)
Holes in my skull, over time
My heart's over ice (Woah)

[Verse 1]
Over ice, I'm freezing
Beautiful eyes, deceiving
We may die this evening
Coughing, wheezing, bleeding
High, I'm an anxious soul
Blood moons are my eyes, stay low
Red and black, they glow
Under attack, in my soul
When it's my time, I'll know
Never seen a hell so cold
Yeah, we'll make it out, I'll know
We'll run right through the flames, let's go (Go)

I'm in too deep
Can't swim like me
We're drowning, so I will see
My demons ten feet, under me
Inhale, exhale, but I can't breathe
Too busy drinking codeine doin' high speeds
Crash, pour a four, sip it slow, make the time pass
Take a pill for the thrill, have a relapse
Devil in my head tryna run gym laps
I ain't tryna race, he don't even know me like that

[Chorus]
All white Gucci suit, I'm feeling righteous
I know that the truth is hard to digest
Five or six pills in my right hand
Codeine runneth over on my nightstand

Holes in my skull, over time

Need round two, I need a sequel
Hit the backboard like a free throw
You next level, you a cheat code
In so deep, you hit my seafloor
Got me singing like Alicia
Got me using all your lingo
Tell your girlfriend that you single
Call me over 'cause I go hard
Sweet lil' bih, fuck like a pornstar
Next day, act just like your road dog
Bitches askin' how you know her
Head game stupid, baby loca
Too loud, callate la boca
Out this world, you supernova
Fuck that, I am coming over

Last so long, bae, you a trooper
Sniper gang, no Bradley Cooper
Hi, I'm Hell, it's nice to meet ya

Shawty, you know you can always stop by
You top five and no, you're not five
And not four, three, or two, but one, girl
I'm hot now, wanna see what's under
The access easy in a sundress
Your accent's leaking on my tongue, yes
You're badder than the song that's sang from Mike Jack
I made you cum and you came right back
You calling me upon a late night
I got you leaking like a brake pipe
Swimming in your sea, just like a diver
I'm in it, just creeping like a Great White
And I might fuck you in your own car
You ride my face just like a pornstar
I'm in it so deep, just caught a broke jaw
And I just want one thing, that's a phone call

[Интро: Drake]
(Yo, Pi'erre, yo, Pi’erre)
Эй

[Припев: Drake & Playboi Carti]
Эй
Ниггеры могут не уважать
Но ниггерам придётся принять
Ведь вся моя музыка идёт прямо из сердца
Люблю своих парней до смерти (Кодеин)
Hype Williams, Lil' X
И если ты не говоришь это своим корешам прямо
То о тебе никто не позаботится, эй, йеа, йеа

[Куплет 1: Drake & Playboi Carti]
Я положил немного льда ей в руку
Я позволил взять ей аванс
Всё пошло не так, как я планировал
Затолкал её в машину
Ей придётся покататься со своим другом
Слышал, что она вернулась к своему прошлому парню
Да мне похуй, эй
Разъезжаю на Гелике по шоссе, ты знаешь меня
Когда я захожу в игру, я словно Kawhi, сметаю всё на пути
Я и lil' Sicko сидим рядом, пересчитываем бабки
Раньше я был интровертом, теперь завожу друзей
Только что купил себе особняк в Turks, он стоит прямо напротив моря (Окей)
Если она приведёт четырёх подруг, то одной я точно займусь лично (Окей, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt)
Эти крошки танцуют для меня у бассейна, они все намокли (Окей)
Полиция в моём городе, мужик, со мной их карманы не будут пустыми (Окей)
Мы с капо пытаемся оставить след в истории и принести мир на восточное побережье
Пусть никто больше не наваривается на бифах (Окей)
Но я могу устроить биф с любым рэпером, я всегда на взводе
Эта детка приехала из Мексики, и она знает, что она - сладкая штучка

[Припев: Drake & Playboi Carti]
Эй (Бип, бип, бип)
Ниггеры могут не уважать
Но ниггерам придётся принять (Принять)
Ведь вся моя музыка идёт прямо из сердца (Принять)
Люблю своих парней до смерти (Кодеин)
Hype Williams, Lil’ X (Бип)
И если ты не говоришь это своим корешам прямо (Бип)
То о тебе никто не позаботится, эй, йеа, йеа

[Куплет 2: Playboi Carti]
Тысячи долларов в карманах моих джинсов от Raf Simons (Тысячи в джинсах, окей)
Бриллианты на зубах, я звоню дантисту, йеа (Окей)
У меня сумка от Goyard, храню все бабки там (Все бабки, йеа)
Каждый раз, как приезжаю домой, ты знаешь, я сажусь за руль Бентли (Йеа, йеа, йеа)
Только что закинул таблетки себе в стакан, йеа, йеа (Только что закинул таблетки, ах)
Детка приехала ко мне просто для того, чтобы я её трахнул (Детка приехала ко мне)
Но я хочу только минет, йеа, только его (Хочу только минет)
И я знаю, что я уже на вершине, но я хочу большего (Окей)
Помню, как спал на полу (Помню, оу йеа)
Теперь я каждый день пахну Christian Dior (Окей, Yohji)
Теперь я каждый день напиваюсь (Лин, лин, лин, лин)
Теперь я каждый день напиваюсь (Лин, лин, лин, лин, окей)
Потратил сотню тысяч баксов в последнюю ночь в Нью-Йорке (Йеа, йеа)
Потратил сотню и на следующий день, мне было скучно (Окей, окей, йеа)
Эта Ламба набирает скорость за секунды (Окей, понял)
Йеа, она продолжает мне написывать, а я игнорю (Йеа, йеа, йеа, йеа)
Йеа (Оу, йеа, йеа, йеа)

[Припев: Drake & Playboi Carti]
Эй
Ниггеры могут не уважать
Но ниггерам придётся принять

Roll up in the four by four, pull up at the corner store
And I got red in my drink when I pour up soda
I remember prayin' that the feds never take the Motorola
Choppa got the chopper, make 'em do a backflip
Pay my dawg a dime to walk him down, he need the racks, bitch
I been drinkin', I been taking all this codeine to the face
Got a lot of M's in the safe
Caught a murder, then I beat the case
I was just about to do the race

Used to dream about gettin' it, now I got it, I don't drive

You buy twenty, I'll front what you buy
I put on drip, I believe I can I fly
Niggas know that I'm rich, but they know not to try
I had a show in Detroit and I stopped at Revive
And spent fifty on all the guys
All of these hoes in these stores make commission
And plus I'ma tip 'em, they holdin' my size
Get in your car and just put on your flashers
And follow the hearse since you say you gon' ride
'Cause somebody gon' die if they fuck with us
Turn a five to a dime, that's a double up
Fuck around, walk through church with my double cup
This shit a habit, I'm prayin' I give it up
Tiger stay with the wood, make 'em give it up
Know I ran through a mil' every week coppin' weed
Bruh beat the charge, I can get me some sleep
Got a backend to pick up, I won't even leave
Run it up, fuck around, give the 'Vette to DT
Keep a hotboy with me, I got love for BG

Emotionally Scarred,Lil Baby,"[Verse 1]
A love letter came through the mail, it said, ""I miss you""
I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue, try to forget you
I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OG's salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, ""Of course""
I just played the hand that I was dealt, didn't have to force
All around the world they know it's me, they hear my voice
And I done it all in a pair of Diors, yeah

[Chorus]
Young age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)
Big stage, long way from Section 8 (Ballin' other countries)
Big wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)
Ridin' in the foreign, chiefin' on the forest
I know I wasn't there for you, at least I said I'm sorry
You know what it was, I told you that I was heartless
I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt

[Verse 2]
All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend
I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz
I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?
I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew? Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that up to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people
I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming
Watched my lil' boy play with toys, I just dropped a tear of joy
Some shit that I feel for
I been going crazy with that scoring, call me Baby Harden
They say I'll be great, I guess I'm waiting for it

Young age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)

And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm a giver
Yeah, and I'm still giving 'em hell
Forgiving's pretty hard
So I made an art out of forgettin' 'em well
Yeah, I'm a rhymer
I can turn 20 cents into a 10
And if I get confused and I start to lose
I rhyme a dime 'til it all makes sense

[Chorus]
And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I turn a light on in my soul
And keep a bluebird in my heart

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Ooh

[Chorus]
And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love starts giving me lemons
Just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart
Keep a bluebird in my heart

[Outro]
Ooh
And the bluebird sings
Ooh"
Here And Now,Kenny Chesney,"[Verse 1]
Seen the skyline of New York City
Fireflies in Tennessee
Sipped a little shine from a paper sack that'll
Knock the horns off a Cadillac
I must've sat on a dozen islands
Watched the sun sink into the sea
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt and hat
But my favorite place to be is

[Chorus]
Here and now
Nowhere else in this world enough
You and me, ain't it good to be alive?
Ain't no better place, ain't no better time
Than here and now
Everybody's waiting, but they're waiting on what?
Better get to living 'cause all we've got is here and now

[Verse 2]
Think I fell in love for the first time
With a girl from Mexico
Thought I found a true love in Malibu, but
That water was a little too cold
Yeah, I left a few tears in the rearview
One or two that were hard to forget
Why you think we call the present the present?
'Cause there ain't no better gift than

[Chorus]
Here and now
Nowhere else in this world enough
You and me, ain't it good to be alive?
Ain't no better place, ain't no better time
Than here and now
Everybody's waiting, but they're waiting on what?
Better get to living 'cause all we've got is here and now

[Bridge]
A lotta people dreaming 'bout one-day-some-days
Waiting just around the bend (Waiting just around the bend)
I used to be one wonderin' when they'd come
But now I'm livin' in (But now I'm livin' in)
Here and now
Yeah, I'm livin' in the

[Chorus]
Here and now
Nowhere else in this world enough
You and me, ain't it good to be alive?
Ain't no better place, ain't no better time
Than here and now
Everybody's waiting, but they're waiting on what?
Better get to living 'cause all we've got is here and now"
Turks,"NAV, Gunna & Travis Scott","[Intro: Future]
(Wheezy outta here)

[Verse 1: NAV]
I'm a late bloomer, third year on the scene
Twenty racks don't feel like nothin' to me
Came from the streets, it turned me to a beast
Invisible set, diamonds huggin' my piece
Book me for a show, I need eighty at least
I want the smoke, ain't no keepin' the peace
Keep me a razor when I'm in the East
Open 'em up just like a surgery
Everything burnin' around me, I'm lit
Show a lil' attitude, swap out the bitch
I spent two-fifty, don't know where it went
My hood on my back, I gotta represent
Toronto, you useless, you don't got a pole
Warm that boy up, he got shot in the cold
Thirty rounds in the clip, let it unload
I fuck the bitch I picked right out of Vogue

[Chorus: NAV]
Took twenty bitches on my first vacay
I ain't pickin' up, I'm in Turks, lil' baby
Every other watch got diamonds in the face
Pullin' out, ask to take a taste, lil' baby
Pullin' out fifty racks, walkin' out of Chase
If I drop dead, I'll be hard to replace
Hardly get thirsty, got water like a lake
My brother got locked, another bond I gotta pay

[Verse 2: Gunna & Future]
Trappin' on the block, I'd never serve a cop
I always kept a Glock, I ain't 'bout to see the grave ('Bout to see the grave)
Pull up, I'll make a quick stop (Yeah)
I shop one stop, I'm high for seven days (High for seven days)
Who is that lil' nigga icy hoppin' out a Wraith? (Hoppin' out a Wraith?)
Chopper get it choppin' like a blade (Chop)
You ain't get no money but you poppin' on your page (Poppin' on your page)
Trust me, we could never be the same (Never be the same)
You know I like to flirt, no skirts in Turks (Yeah)
I'm puttin' in work, I beat her out the frame (Beat her out the frame, Wheezy outta here)
She sweet, I was movin' off a Perc'
I bought her a Birk' and a birthday cake (Birthday cake)
Line his ass up like a barber do the fade (Barber do the fade)
Fed your ho crêpes and grapes
Cash told me, ""Wait, it's a billion on the way"" (Billion on the way)
We just split a billi' with the gang

[Chorus: NAV]
Took twenty bitches on my first vacay
I ain't pickin' up, I'm in Turks, lil' baby
Every other watch got diamonds in the face
Pullin' out, ask to take a taste, lil' baby
Pullin' out fifty racks, walkin' out of Chase
If I drop dead, I'll be hard to replace
Hardly get thirsty, got water like a lake
My brother got locked, another bond I gotta pay

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
First time in Turks, had a whole bunch of work
Had to bring two jets, had a whole lot of babes (Yeah)
I first take a game-changin' verse
Swear the change gon' hurt, but it really ain't a game (Yeah)
Shawty like to twerk, I bring the rage (Yeah)
Really get to trippin' on the stage
Never ever let 'em see the man unless they pay  (Alright)
Niggas havin' beef, I hope they pray
Cactus Jack me up and down, head to toe
Make sure the ones you with on go
Make sure the ones you with is with it
Make sure the ones you with, ah (Yeah)
She need a quick tan, come to Turks with the G's (Yeah)
Work for that body, need more than degrees
Fillin' her nose with some shit I can ski with
Say this her first time, it's hard to believe

[Chorus: NAV]
Took twenty bitches on my first vacay
I ain't pickin' up, I'm in Turks, lil' baby
Every other watch got diamonds in the face
Pullin' out, ask to take a taste, lil' baby
Pullin' out fifty racks, walkin' out of Chase

If The World Was Ending,JP Saxe Featuring Julia Michaels,"[Verse 1]

[H.E.R., Niall Horan & Keith Urban]
I was distracted and in traffic
I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', were you out drinkin'?
Were you in the living room, chillin', watchin' television?
It's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to let you go and let communication die out

[Pre-Chorus]

[FINNEAS & Alessia Cara]
I know, you know, we know you weren't
Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't
Meant for each other and it's fine

[Chorus]

[Jason Derulo, Kesha, Zara Larsson & Alessia Cara]
But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant

[Kelsea Ballerini, Sam Smith & The Rose]
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye

[Pink Sweat$, Jordan Davis, Sasha Sloan & Anne-Marie]
I tried to imagine your reaction
It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', the night we went drinkin'
Stumbled in the house and didn't make it past the kitchen

Ah, it's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out

Maintenant, ma belle dit qu'elle veut sucer jusqu'au bout
Je suis à fond, bébé, je veux tes quatre lèvres (je suis à fond)
Ex-camarade de classe, elle peut aspirer un bateau
Je mange de la molly et j'emmène cette salope en trip
Ayy, ma belle, ayy, chérie, ayy, mon bébé, suce mon intimité
Ferme tes yeux, c'est juste toi et moi et personne
Ayy, suce-le sur le côté, si on est en public ou dans l'allée (Hey)
Des sensations avec cette salope (Woo), des sensations sur un jet (Woo)
Cinq mille coupures, ooh
Elle est aussi mauvaise que possible, sa bouche la fait marcher
Elle sait qu'elle a eu le déclic
Avec une chatte de bouche d'incendie (Hey)

Baiser à l'ouest (Baiser), vendre à l'ouest (Ouais)

[Couplet 2 : Travis Scott]
C'est en haut, c'est coincé (Ouais)
Je pensais que tu pouvais rejoindre le gang, à quoi tu pensais ? (Gang)
Le coupé rouge, le bruit des montagnes russes comme il le fait
Ces jours-ci, j'équilibre toute la haine avec l'amour
Ces jours-ci, je verse toute ma douleur dans un verre (Verre)
Rêveur, c'est juste un effet secondaire quand tu es avec nous (Jeu)
Du calme, les gars sont juste derrière moi, ils sont sur les nerfs
Crois-moi, on sort en ville pour amasser (Ooh)
Les sensations avec cette salope, ils ont surpris que je vivais (C'est la merde)
Essayer, ne peut pas être tué, essayé neuf fois mais je suis Stilts
Sauter dans la caisse pour sauter directement avec le fouet
Aqua dans la caisse, t'as capté (Ooh)

In Between,Scotty McCreery,"[Verse 1]
I'm a little bit a ball cap
Little bit a pearl snap button down shirt
Little bit a big city concrete
But a lot more small town dirt

I can see your pretty eyes
Reading me like a map
Wondering who I am
And where I'm at

[Chorus]
I'm in between
Friday night wild
And quiet Sunday morning
Between
Done after one
And keep on pouring
Ain't too high
Ain't too low
Just holding down the middle
I'm steady as I go
I ain't all holy water
And I ain't all Jim Beam
I'm somewhere in between

[Verse 2]
I can be a steel toe work boot
40 hour blue collar, mud on my jeans
Then on weekend pack a bag
Disappear kick back on a white sand beach

I'm a far cry from being
A one night stand
But I ain't ready
For a ring on my hand

[Chorus]
I'm in between
Friday night wild
And quiet Sunday morning
Between
Done after one
And keep on pouring
Ain't too high
Ain't too low
Just holding down the middle
I'm steady as I go
I ain't all holy water
And I ain't all Jim Beam
I'm somewhere in between

I can see your pretty eyes
Reading me like a map
Wondering who I am
And where I'm at

And keep on pouring
Ain't too high
Ain't too low

More Hearts Than Mine,Ingrid Andress,"[Verse 1]
I can't wait to show you where I grew up
Walk you 'round the foothills of my town
Probably feel like you've been there before
After hearing all the stories I've been telling you
For six months now

[Verse 2]
We'll probably have to sleep in separate bedrooms
Pack a shirt for church, because we'll go
I'm not trying to scare you off, but
I just thought that we should talk
A few things out before we hit the road

[Chorus]
If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Take you fishin', but pretend that he don't like you
Oh, if we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine

[Verse 3]
My sister's gonna ask a million questions
Say anything she can to turn you red
And when you meet my high school friends
They'll buy you drinks and fill you in
On all the crazy nights I can't outlive

[Chorus]
So if I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Buy you dinner, but pretend that he don't like you
Oh, if we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine

[Bridge]
Oh
Mmh

[Chorus]
If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She feels every heartache I go through
And if my dad sees me cryin'
He'll pour some whiskey over ice and
Tell a lie and say he never really liked you
Oh, if we break up I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine
You'll be breaking more hearts than mine"

Godzilla,Eminem Featuring Juice WRLD,"Ох, да ты просто монстр

[Куплет 1: Dicon]
Я могу выпить бутылку. Алкоголь - и я, словно Гадзилла
Попаду в колоду, будто крупье в казино
Весь мой сквад тут на тусе ходит туда-сюда
Помесь зомби апокалипсиса и Бобби Хинана ""Мозга"" я
Ведь со мной вновь сражается также моя же мания
Shady вернулся, взрывать пора
Говоришь, от меня клонит в сон тебя?
Вот тогда тебе бессоница
У тебя дефицит внимания, успокойся и слушай сейчас меня
Чел, выпей коньяка
Убью из АК с кулака, для меня это не больше, чем игра
Отсякай, видишь меня отступай, тут орёт тревога
Этот бит сумасшедший, смешной (хах), как будто Ray J
Угараю по дороге до банка, брызжа слюной, вам не успокоить
Во мне...

[Припев: Dicon]
Монстра
Встанешь на пути моём, скормлю тебя монстру
Весь день такой как ты, но ночью превращаюсь в монстра
При свете луны, что сияет так ясно
Я становлюсь злодеем. Это мой блокбастер
Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр
В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол
Всё горит, Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр
В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол

[Куплет 2: Dicon]
Я лишь продукт Слика Рика из Оникса, своим треком их ужасну
Разозлю, хоть их сотни всех. Невозможно даже перечесть
И вдобавок ко всему этому я в психушке в руках верчу
Магический шар
В попытках узнать, каково будет завтра:
После рисперидона будет ли шанс?
Мой кулак, будто карандаш, чертит круги на стене
Черти кричат все во мне
Эта песня даст веру тебе
Ты направил свой ствол на парня с базукой в руке
Я из Лох-Несса вылез, прямо из мифов
Как только грохну свой полтиник водки
Лишь откручу крышку, ты увидишь...

[Припев: Dicon]
Монстра
Встанешь на пути моём, скормлю тебя монстру
Весь день такой как ты, но ночью превращаюсь в монстра
При свете луны, что сияет так ясно
Я становлюсь злодеем. Это мой блокбастер
Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр
В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол
Всё горит, Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр
В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол

[Куплет 3: Dicon]
Если тебе так же пох, руки вверх!
Ведь я уже собрался в отдых. Бэд Трип подъехал
Нахожусь на месте, как мой индекс, теперь всё, что ты увидишь
Лишь мой средний палец, подниму выше!
Как у меня могут быть только фаны?
Горю, как у лжеца память
Я не думал вас даже оставить без восхищений текстами
И эти дамы прекрасны, меня заводят опасно
И я их очаровал всех, они теряют сознание
И всё снова крутится, крутится, словно цепь бензопилы
Я машу волшебной палочкой, как битой, исполню мечты
Сука, я сделал эти бабки слишком просто как Кид Инк
Называй меня Дидди
Создаю группы, что мне дают прибыль
Слышь, я в игре, скуп на делёж, что принадлежит мне
Я не дам слова тебе, не притворюсь даже, мэн
Но я сказал суке, что женюсь на ней, если она после будет в земле
Я как Ричард Рамирес ебашу людей
Не стою на месте, как Кристиан Ривера
Все мои тексты вихляют подобно мне
Как при параличе, это страшно, я зову что Гарри Карей
Ведь каждый Том. Дик и Гарри всегда имеют грёбанный словарь при себе
Это смешно и нелепо. Ведь они подобно мне
Трясутся над ним, божатся, клянутся над ним
Пришло время пересечься с глазу на глаз с этой острой проблемой
Пора быстрее, составить некролог о каждом. Теперь и мне похер, поверь
Пора палить, зарядил ствол, полон чернил он
Злая половина меня сместит вновь, и людей привлекают мои тексты всё ещё
Он смотрят на них, как на гангстеров
Будто я буду щас стрелять всех
Каждый трей, как джингл, в магазин вложил их
Теперь пришло время их всех положить!

Наполняю ядом и рядом перебиваю
Другими словами, я из них соки выжимаю
Не хотел убивать всех, но я в приступе ярости
Ты не в силах сбежать теперь, я не чувствую жалости
Они меня ненавидят, и я не знаю усталости, и вот я настигаю их
И перемалываю в ярости
Я чувствую, будто бы стал на голову тронутым, во мне демон
И я знаю, он по крови их голоден
Либо ты убиваешь, либо убит будешь скоро ты, я подорву тебя
И раскидаю в разные стороны
Моя каждая часть сделана из зла и насилия
Если ты меня увидишь, то поверь, ты бессилен
Убегай или молись, но никак не беси меня, или в ту же минуту
Я разорву на куски тебя
Ты не станешь как я даже на пару процентов
Я собираюсь покончить с тобой, ты знаешь об этом
Меня подобные тебе вызывают на бэттл, но я не победим
Вовсе не убиваем и неподелен
Переделываю строки и не знаю предела я
У меня есть много денег, они раскиданы в трейлере
Я не боюсь потянутся за моим...

Чел стой
Смотри что в планах!
Хах"

God Whispered Your Name,Keith Urban,"[Verse 1]
I was so cold and lost
And nothing seemed to ring true
I couldn't bear the cross
For everything I'd been through
And each day, I knew I needed change
But there was no way, no way

And then God whispered your name
And that's when everything changed
And love came out of the rain
And talk about being saved
Suddenly I wanna live
More than I ever did
I'm never gonna be the same
When God whispered your name

I can see the sunshine
For the first time in a while
Girl, it's like I've been baptized
By the warmth of your smile, hmm
Well, call it fate or faith or call it crazy either way
It's amazin', amazin' grace

When God whispered your name
That's when everything changed
Love came out of the rain
Talk about being saved
Well, suddenly I wanna live
More than I ever did
I'm never gonna be the same

It's just what I needed to hear, baby
It couldn't have been more loud and clear

To come and look at my front door?

I'm gonna laugh about this someday
You didn't see the way he drove away

Catch a spark and start a flame

Neck froze like I don't know no better
Benzo truck, white seats and they leather
Go broke never, on my grind

New tints on the coupé, that's her head lost
Off my whites, right my wrongs

I really hope this time my worker don't floss
See, I was in the wok, now my penthouse at the top
Shawty said they're best friends, I bet they both fuck
'Cause they won't cuss, 'cause they said I sold drugs
And when you down there, ain't nobody around
Where's the comeback? When you blow up
I forgot my jacket but my heated seats help me warm up
Fast train to Inverurie, I used to go up

Used to say I wanna put Tottenham on the map

I'm in that 8 and that 1 and that 2, this a different Ferrari, yeah
I tried to pay all your loans off and cop you a driver, yeah
I had you stayin' too close to the city, you actin' too vulnerable livin' this life

How the fuck you keep so many secrets?
How you goin' vegan, but still beefin' with me again?
How the fuck you've seen so many beaches?
Tickets to them places don't come cheap, and
I see you back in Turks
Remember who took you there first and don't you forget it
Got you a whip, but then you got back on your shit
I had to tell Eric go get it
I'm always movin' too fast, the feeling don't last
I feel like you take me for granted
Probably my fault for the way that I handle it

Ooh, shawty, you tried it
Voice gettin' filled with entitlement
Why would you tell me those lies? And
Why would you make it so bold to my face?
Why are your stories all over the place?
Whole lotta secrets friends don't keep safe
Where did your friends all go? (Woo)
I can't solve your problems
You say your problems never needed solvin'
I was too good to you, should've stayed solid
Nice guys always finish off where they started
Déjà vu, you wanted things and you got 'em
Déjà vu, I wanted smoke and I got it
Déjà vu, déjà
Déjà

Alright, so unfortunately, I'm still here (Hahaha)
But, you know, if you're here, it's still up
In the building

I'm outside in an AMG
Right outside, TT

Okey, vamos, negro
(Rocco lo hizo otra vez)
Espera un segundo, ¿quién eres? (Ey, yo, K.i.D.)

[Coro: YoungBoy Never Broke Again & DaBaby]
Lo hago saltar como, como crack en los 80
Bebé, estos maricones no están locos
Soy pobre, ASCAP va directo a mi bebé
(Espera, Lil Top, diles, negro)
Y le haré hablarme mientras cogemos (Respóndeme)
Piedras grandes en mi muñeca, le puse diamantes (Bling)
Una Glock grande en mi cadera, la agarro (Vamos)
Me pierdo en una perra, no es nada

[Verso 1: DaBaby]
Ella dice que me veo bien, perra, estuve haciendo flexiones
Si juegas con Baby y Top, negro, buena suerte
Mi hija tiene dos años, pero también seis figuras
Le saco la cabeza del cuello antes de que mire para arriba
Diez dedos del pie en sus pechos por un cheque, perra, me paré (¿Qué significa?)
Me paré en sus cuellos por un cheque (Ajá)
Ahora mi cabeza los estresa, soy un veterano
Gano 300 mil por un concierto, perra, estoy bendecido

[Verso 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Voy a enloquecerme y a bailar, esas putas bajan
Disparo, no tengo frenos (Bah, bauh)
Te caemos una y otra vez, juega, vamos a manejarlo
Voy a entrar con Three y Montana
Voy a bailar, no esperaré a tocarlo
Él empezó, sabes que su mierda estará cancelada (Cancelar su culo)
Pongo esa arma en tu cara, grito 4KTrey
Desde el norte de Baton Rouge hasta Atlanta
Lo noqueo, pongo mi dinero encima de él, perra (¿Qué carajo?)
Controlo mi ciudad, a la policía no le gusta
Saben que estamos con las armas (Pisando esta mierda)
Pongo esa pistola en tu hermano, te sientes de una manera
Lo hice enojar, le dije que entierre a esa perra (Entierra esa perra)
Disparo 200, apuesto una, ¿cómo sigues vivo, negro?
Sabes que tengo esta mierda (Yo también, negro)
Paranoico todo el día, me siento de una manera
Cuando traes la estática y eso

[Verso 3: DaBaby]
Cambio el canal, estamos arreglando la estática (Cambiemos)
Le doy un porro con tabaco, se lo puede quedar
Cuando llego a golpear va rápido, piensan que es una automática (Bum, bum, vamos)
El negro va a tratar de esconderse en su casa
Lo agarro para que salga, me la cojo en el tráfico (Como bum)
Hice una canción en diez minutos, se hizo platino
Sé que seguimos en estas mierdas, le doy una pitada, nos activamos (Sí)
Menciona a Baby y YB, el juego bajo candado (Sí)
Mi perra tiene ese culo sin cintura, bonita cara
Tiene abdominales marcados, negros piensan que se operó
Le doy por atrás hasta que nos desmayemos (Ajá)
Se lo hago como Kurt Angle a la perra, su pierna en el aire, llave de tobillo
La sostengo hasta que se rinda (Perra)
Sé independiente en tu calle con el arma afuera (Independiente)
A la mierda ese rapero, déjame ver de qué se tratan esos mil dólares
Tengo una pistola nueva, negro

[Coro: YoungBoy Never Broke Again & DaBaby]
Lo hago saltar como, como crack en los 80
Bebé, estos maricones no están locos
Soy pobre, ASCAP va directo a mi bebé
(Espera, Lil Top, diles, negro)
Y le haré hablarme mientras cogemos (Respóndeme)
Piedras grandes en mi muñeca, le puse diamantes (Bling)
Una Glock grande en mi cadera, la agarro (Vamos)
Me pierdo en una perra, no es nada

[Verso 4: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Chequeo de micrófono, uno-dos, chequeo uno, mato a dos
Si hablamos de asesinato, sabes cómo lo hacemos
Cuando llegue a esta mierda, deja tus manos para ti mismo
Sucede, disparo, giro en un coupé (Bang, bang)
Cuando entras a mi casa, ves todo nuevo
Probablemente encontrarás un arma en cada habitación
Fui y compré un Rollie sobre este Patek
Pero, perra, no está puesto, llegaré con dos
Ella dice que le gusto, sí
Estamos en su culo en cuanto llegamos a la habitación
Negro no me conoce, sí, estamos siguiéndolo
Lo acechamos desde el día hasta la luna
Negro de calle, nunca agarro y elijo
Llevo conmigo algo que hace que estos maricones se muevan (Maricón)
En cuanto le caemos, le haremos sucio
Sabes que no es determinado, no dejamos huellas, negro

[Interludio: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Espera, soy Lil Top, negro, créelo

[Coro: YoungBoy Never Broke Again & DaBaby]
Lo hago saltar como, como crack en los 80
Bebé, estos maricones no están locos
Soy pobre, ASCAP va directo a mi bebé
(Espera, Lil Top, diles, negro)
Y le haré hablarme mientras cogemos (Respóndeme)
Piedras grandes en mi muñeca, le puse diamantes (Bling)
Una Glock grande en mi cadera, la agarro (Vamos)
Me pierdo en una perra, no es nada

[Verso 5: DaBaby]
Lo hago saltar como Giannis (Solo honesto)
Tratando de ver cómo se siente por detrás de ella (Vamos)
Sabía que esa perra no era nadie, no se merece chupar pene
Le hago chupármela sin condón (Ajá)
Quieres apostar y perder, consigámoslo
Ponemos dinero en su gorra como si fuese una a medida (No miento)
Baby llega al 2020, se va como si nada
Ese negro está actuando, se está cagando (Brrum)
Me drogo solo en el palco (Sí)
Salí de la casa, dos F&N para el día (Dos)
¿Por qué sacas las dos, negro? ¿Negro, por qué no? (¿Por qué?)
Dejándolos ir como un profesional, déjalos intentar ahora (Intentemos)
No puedo irme como una puta, voy a pagar la fianza (Perra)
Le envío a mi hermano, sube puntos, déjalos averiguar (Arriba)
Recojo a mi chica de la escuela y nos vamos (Muah)
Si cualquier puta que se ponga irrespetuosa la castigamos, diles, negro

[Coro: YoungBoy Never Broke Again & DaBaby]
Lo hago saltar como, como crack en los 80
Bebé, estos maricones no están locos
Soy pobre, ASCAP va directo a mi bebé

Cúlpalo a Baby, negro, sí
Cúlpalo al hijo de puta de Baby, negro, cúlpalo a Baby, negro
Cúlpalo a Baby

Me Vs Me,Moneybagg Yo,"[Intro]
Turn me up YC (Turn me up YC, turn me up YC), go

[Chorus]
I ain't ever ran from a nigga (No I ain't never, ever), if I did, cut my legs off (Right now)
I ain't ever been with the ho talk, snitch talk, always talking 'bout his fault (No)
Yeah, I'm a stand up nigga, got my bands up, nigga, you don't wanna see me pissed off (Real talk)
Never tell a lie to a bitch, dawg (No), when it come to them, you gotta play it raw
And I ain't never ever let the fuckery get to me (Why not?) Niggas ain't worth my energy (What you had to do?)
Cut 'em off, make 'em feel it, I ain't dealin' with nothin' if it don't make sense to me (Never ever, ever)
I'll never ever, ever go against my kind for some niggas on the other side (Never ever, ever)
I'll never ever, ever put a bitch 'fore the money, gotta get it when it come to mine

[Verse 1]
Lately I feel like it's me versus me, don't see competition, why would you compete? (Huh?)
Don't even gotta be woke, still gon' be up (How?), I make a bag in my sleep (Okay)
Can't get the hood outta me, you know where I be (Where?) Still posted up like I lease (Now)
Trust me, them choppers gon' bang, cavity teeth, you better not think this shit sweet (Splat)
If the bitch bad put a stack in her rack (Go)
I'm Dr. Seuss, give me cat in the hat (Woah)
Booty poke out and her stomach on snatch
Way to pretty to be fucked from the back (Ugh)
Count up some money then smoke me a plant
This shit got me higher than Ja Morant (Up there)
Toxic lil' bitch and she knowin' she that
I said I was done, still doubled back
If you a side bitch you can not question me
You did some foul shit, you threw a TEC at me
Cook it up right, they done gave me the recipe
I'm in a Z06, police ain't catchin' me
I'm still duckin' this bitch that's obsessed with me
'Cause I'm the dope like the coke in the '70s
Big body double R truck, I got Bo with me
Hoggin' the lane, now they can't get close to me (Big bag)

[Chorus]
I ain't ever ran from a nigga (No I ain't never, ever), if I did, cut my legs off (Right now)
I ain't ever been with the ho talk, snitch talk, always talking 'bout his fault (No)
Yeah, I'm a stand up nigga, got my bands up, nigga, you don't wanna see me pissed off (Real talk)
Never tell a lie to a bitch, dawg (No), when it come to them, you gotta play it raw
And I ain't never ever let the fuckery get to me (Why not?) Niggas ain't worth my energy (What you had to do?)
Cut 'em off, make 'em feel it, I ain't dealin' with nothin' if it don't make sense to me (I can't deal)
I'll never ever, ever go against my kind for some niggas on the other side (Never ever, ever)
I'll never ever, ever put a bitch 'fore the money, gotta get it when it come to mine

[Verse 2]
Check the thermostat, I've been hot four summers (Hot)
Try me, you get whacked, make it hard for your mama
Moneybagg Runtz in the pack, get a bundle
Plaque and the sack, both of 'em doing numbers
I ain't got a heart for a ho, that's a big no (No go)
No-life worry 'bout the next ho (Why, though?)
Took back the keys to the Benzo
All in her feelings, throwin' clothes out the window (Psycho)
Let's take a AK, cut it in half and call it a Draco (Let's go)
I'm back on my old ways, ridin' with that five, volcano that fuego
Life insurance on my chain (Your life)
Reach for it, bust your brain (Night, night)
Loose noodle, no lo mein (Take out)
Going out the way I came (Same route)

[Chorus]
I ain't ever ran from a nigga (No I ain't never, ever), if I did, cut my legs off (Right now)
I ain't ever been with the ho talk, snitch talk, always talking 'bout his fault (No)
Yeah, I'm a stand up nigga, got my bands up, nigga, you don't wanna see me pissed off (Real talk)
Never tell a lie to a bitch, dawg (No), when it come to them, you gotta play it raw
And I ain't never ever let the fuckery get to me (Why not?) Niggas ain't worth my energy (What you had to do?)
Cut 'em off, make 'em feel it, I ain't dealin' with nothin' if it don't make sense to me (Never ever, ever)
I'll never ever, ever go against my kind for some niggas on the other side (Never ever, ever)
I'll never ever, ever put a bitch 'fore the money, gotta get it when it come to mine (Go)"
Drinking Alone,Carrie Underwood,"[Intro]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1]
Let me make one thing clear
You can buy me a beer, but you ain't taking me home
No pick up lines, I came here tonight to shed a few tears on my own
But sitting there across the room
I couldn't help but notice you seem a little down on your love too
Yeah, my heart might be breaking
But, this seat ain't taken
And you've got me thinkin'

[Chorus]
We should be drinking alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
We should be drinking alone, together (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2]
I don't know what she did to make you hurt like this
But, I know just what to do
It starts with a bottle of good Reposado
And ends with a shooter or two
Tomorrow when the sun comes up
Tonight’s the night that never was
Baby, just forget my name
Won't be your one and only
But just 'cause we're lonely, don't mean that we should

[Chorus]
We should be drinking alone
'Cause drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone
Drinking alone, drinking alone (Together)
Maybe we shouldn't be drinking alone (We should be drinking alone)
Drinking alone, drinking alone
Baby, we shouldn't be drinking alone

[Bridge]
I'll pretend that I care
Baby, pull up a chair
We'll stay here 'til they make us go home

[Chorus]
We should be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, we should be drinking alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone (Drinking alone, drinking alone) together
Maybe we shouldn't be drinking alone (We should be drinking alone)
Drinking alone, drinking alone
Baby, we shouldn't be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Outro]
We should be drinking alone

Ooh, ooh, ooh"
Six Feet Apart,Luke Combs,"[Verse 1]
When the dogwoods start to bloom
And the crickets hum their tune
That's usually about the time
That I feel most alive
But the news has all been bad
And the whole world seems so sad
I ain't had much else going on
So I sat down and wrote this song

[Chorus]
I miss my mom, I miss my dad
Miss the road, I miss my band
Giving hugs and shaking hands
It's a mystery, I suppose
Just how long this thing goes
But there'll be crowds and there'll be shows
And there will be light after dark
Some day when we aren't six feet apart

[Verse 2]
First thing that I'm gonna do
Slide on in some corner booth
And take the whole damn family out
Buy my buddies all a round
Pay some extra on the tab
Catch a movie, catch a cab
Watch a ball game from the stands
Probably over-wash my hands

[Chorus]
I miss my mom, I miss my dad
Miss the road, I miss my band
Giving hugs and shaking hands
Well, it's a mystery, I suppose
Just how long this thing goes
But there'll be crowds and there'll be shows
And there will be light after dark
Some day when we aren't six feet apart

[Chorus]
I miss my mom, I miss my dad
I miss the road, I miss my band
Giving hugs and shaking hands
Well, it's a mystery, I suppose
Just how long this thing goes
But there'll be crowds and there'll be shows
And there will be light after dark
Some day when we aren't six feet apart

[Outro]
There will be light after dark
Some day when we aren't six feet apart"
Viral Moment,Lil Durk,"[Intro]
(TouchofTrent be wildin' with it)

[Verse 1]
I pour an eight inside the Lam' truck, fell asleep flyin'
I thought them niggas had my back, but I'm steady seein' signs
And I can't turn my back on Boona like I ain't see him tryin'
These tears shed, whenever he dead, it's different seein' him die
Bah, get close up on 'em, you know that shit be graphic
You gotta pop out with that ratchet, you know this shit get tragic
And you can't fumble with that stick, you know this shit ain't Madden
All that shit you did in the streets, you know that shit gon' vanish
Yeah, I pop these pills, they try to read my thoughts
And you can't dig back in your past 'cause you got time you lost
And make that time up for your kids 'cause you know time ain't bought
Booka bought me a diamond cross, but he know he won't cross me
They turned they back and said they'd kill me, yeah, that's when they lost me
I put baguettie inside the Cartier 'cause I'm feelin' bossy
They feel some type of way in the county jail, I told 'em call me
I built a relationship with the real with niggas who never saw me
Yeah, I seen my chance and that's when I grabbed it
Fuck bein' a hundred, I spent a couple hundred on niggas' tablets
Lean gave me chest pains, that's when I popped the Perky tablet
I tried to get that family vibe for niggas who wasn't established
You do that shit again, what you did to bro gon' get you a casket
I did shit for niggas without them askin'
I broke pounds for niggas without them matchin'
I don't fuck with you, I'ma tell y'all nah even though I got it

[Interlude]
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
This shit was different, we was together like ten years ago
And I don't talk to a lotta niggas, but they still the bros
The ones I ain't talk to like that back then, know they still hoes
And some niggas try to hide they hate, but that shit still show
I never fucked on block hoes because I call 'em sisters
One hate me right now as I speak because I called her a hooker
Cut the loose ends, I cut 'em off, they try to say I'm a butcher
Bitch, you a rat, never mind, I changed my life, I'm Muslim
I talked to Chops on FaceTime, he say, ""Damn, you back smokin'""
He say, ""That back door damn near closed,"" I say, ""It's back open""
I say, ""These blocks could be back one,"" he say, ""You back hopin'""
You gotta watch them niggas you love 'cause they still backdoorin'
He ain't got no hope in beatin' his trial because he lost his motion
Bro got life, he don't know how pussy smell, that's why he fuck his lotion
I know some real niggas would lose it all for a viral moment
My dreads swing, I feel like Wayne, show me my opponent

[Outro]
You know, I like talkin' to the streets, like
When you say you the voice, you gotta, like, open up, like
Tell motherfuckers, like, what it is, like, you can't hold nothin' back
You gotta relate to them, relate to the poverty, you know what I'm sayin'?
Relate to the trenches
You know what I'm sayin', I can't be talkin' 'bout a Richard Mille all the time, know what I'm sayin'?
Some of the guys don't even know what the fuck a Richard Mille is
Know what I'm sayin'? You gotta relate
All angles, know what I'm sayin'?
The voice
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"

Homemade,Jake Owen,"[Verse 1]
Where I grew up, gettin' dressed up means
Buttoned down shirt and a good pair of jeans
Wasn’t Sunday supper without collard greens
Dad was boss, Christ is king
Friday night was livin' for them lights to come on
Then I turned to Miller Lites when I turned 21
There's some things about me that I can’t change
I'll always be the man that home made

[Chorus]
Home made me love a dirt road
Home made me crave some ice cold homemade
Sweet tea only mama knows how to make
Homemade
Home made me love a small town
Home made me wanna settle down in a home made
For the two of us
Everything I love is homemade

[Verse 2]
My pickup lines didn't seem to work
Guess my pickup truck must've got to her
Windows down, singin' every word
Of that George Strait mixtape that was homemade

[Chorus]
Home made me love a dirt road
Home made me crave some ice cold homemade
Sweet tea only mama knows how to make
Homemade
Home made me love a small town
Home made me wanna settle down in a home made
For the two of us
Everything I love is homemade

[Bridge]
Hey, what we got you can't get from a store
Hey, the good stuff comes from the good Lord
Homemade

[Chorus]
Home made me love a dirt road
Home made me crave some ice cold homemade
Sweet tea only mama knows how to make
Homemade
Home made me love a small town
Home made me wanna settle down in a home made
For the two of us
Everything I love is homemade

I just caught a shawty off a finsta
Just threw on a hoodie, it's a Crenshaw
Way that I been livin' unconventional
I'm just tryna make it to the end, ya know
Certain things just started gettin' tenser
Think we need to have us an adventure
I could be your man but maybe down the road
Right now I would rather see my heart turn to chrome
Rather see my heart turn crystal
I can't even front like I don't miss ya
Right now I'm just stuck inside the crib on my own
Soon as I free up, I'm 'bout to pop up on your phone like

[Chorus]
I'm outside in an AMG
Right outside, TT
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me, yeah
Who am I? All the niggas 'round me ride or they die
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Heart's still on javelin, baby
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me
I was pullin' off 'fore they knew me
Sometimes I wish there was two of me or three of me
When it was you and me
I felt like I love you too much to change you
You believe in angles more than angels
Feel like I've been going through too much to explain to you
But I'm still the same way I was when I came to you
Everything I have, what I had to exchange for you
Everything I've been through, I can't even complain to you
Wish it stayed the same for you, sorry
I'm sorry

Grace,Lil Baby & 42 Dugg,"[Verse 1: 42 Dugg]
Got a lotta new flames, still need them blue
Three hundred fifty thou', times that by two
New Dawn, no roof, I still see the sky
Peace to my grandma, I can still see my guys
Turned his back, must've felt let down
Heard I'm down seven hundred, what you gon' bet now?
Yeah, I used to be a twerp, bitch, a vet now

Only nigga made sure that I was eatin'
Free Nef still, nigga, RIP Reese
Get her nails done, still charge for the feature
Baby, we ain't that, nah, we ain't this
All that fuckin', I don't do no kissin'
Bitches ain't shit, word to my niggas
All in my mentions (Damn)
Bitch really wanna get hired
Tell the lil' hoes I'm Bryson

Get popped, nigga, I ain't doin' no fightin'
Sinnin' 'bout cash, I ain't doin' no right

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Car too fast, can't stop at no light
I hit the gas, it skrrt, then I pull off
I'm on they ass, I just took a year off
She shakin' her ass, call me when she get off
Took half a mil' for my lil' bro to get out
That new Richard Mille made me feel like a boss
Feel like I'm Meech when I'm ridin' in these cars
Who you know pull up whole entourage in a foreign?
I got designer for days, but it's somethin' about 'em
Go crazy for white Air Force 1's, maybe 'cause I'm a dope boy
He be loud, but he ain't makin' no noise
'Ventador on the ground like a skateboard
If I want it, I get it, I pay for it
I pay extra, I ain't tryna wait for it
Everything that I got, it was made for me
I was servin' them trap houses faithfully
Everybody with me gotta eat
Say your grace with me

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Thou shall not try one of us, if they do, I'ma bust
Please don't reach for no chain
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang
Ran up my check, when I walk in the bank
They greet me at the door by my government name
I made a promise, I'm never gon' change
Rolls-Royce umbrella, I'm hopin' it rain, yeah

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
Right back on it, designer my garments
Corner store mornings, there until the sun down
I don't trust no one, I can't put my gun down
Goin' number one now, hottest out, hands down
Bands out, pants down, yeah, I'm thuggin'
I done got rich, everybody my cousin
You ain't servin' no packs with me, you ain't my brother
That chopper go through shit, I call it the cutter
I just bought a new whip, I went bought another
My mother, she happy now
Ain't no cap and gown, but I graduated
Her house paid for, and that new Mercedes
Know you see that they been tryna be me lately
I'm a heavy hitter like Gervonta Davis
That shit ain't gon' save 'em, leave 'em on the pavement
All I know is get this motherfuckin' paper

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Thou shall not try one of us, if they do, I'ma bust
Please don't reach for no chain
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang
Ran up my check, when I walk in the bank
They greet me at the door by my government name (Hello?)
I made a promise, I'm never gon' change
Rolls-Royce umbrella, I'm hopin' it rain, yeah

[Verse 4: 42 Dugg]
Bitches ain't shit, doggybone, I get it
Fell in love twice, had me in my feelings
Three months, dropped damn near a half a million
Nigga, fuck a house, I done damn lost a building
Fucked a nigga's ho, so he say he wanna kill me
I miss Tev, this shit was different
I miss Nef, rest in peace to my niggas
Damn near went deaf, when they told me they killed you
Turn rat? Nigga, fuck on
Thirteen thou' VVS buffs on
Still'll flood a nigga town with a truckload
Get the head, I'm out, I don't trust hoes
If the feds in the house, a nigga told on me
I pray to God my soul to keep
G5 just beat his murder
Body got picked up, doggy I'm hurt
Still pay the lawyer even though I'm nervous

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Thou shall not try one of us, if they do, I'ma bust
Please don't reach for no chain
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang
Ran up my check, when I walk in the bank
They greet me at the door by my government name
I made a promise, I'm never gon' change

Slow Dance In A Parking Lot,Jordan Davis,"[Verse 1]
Lights go down, wheels go 'round
I'm taking you home
Hoping for a slow song to come on the radio now
I'm not ready to shut it down
The way the dashboard glow
Is hitting your eyes making me lose everything on my mind
And the only thing I wanna do is find a spot
Stop this car and throw it in park and just

[Chorus]
Slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot
(Slow dance in a parking lot)

[Verse 2]
A half song gone, one door open, across the lot
A rent-a-cop's rolling a security car
Its yellow lights spinning and flashing in time
To the radio singing a little Garth Brooks
You start humming the very last verse to ""She's Every Woman""
And I don't care what song comes next
I'm falling right here, don't want a safety net in a

[Chorus]
Slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot

[Post-Chorus]
And get close to you
Making the most of whatever we got, even if it's just

[Chorus]
A slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot"
You Should Be Sad,Halsey,"[Verse 1]
I wanna start this out and say
I gotta get it off my chest (My chest)
Got no anger, got no malice
Just a little bit of regret (Regret)
Know nobody else will tell you
So there's some things I gotta say
Gonna jot it down and then get it out
And then I'll be on my way

[Pre-Chorus]
No, you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you

[Chorus]
Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad
And I had no warning about who you are
I'm just glad I made it out without breaking down
And then ran so fucking far
That you would never ever touch me again
Won't see your alligator tears
'Cause know I've had enough of them

I'm gonna start this out by saying (By saying)
I really meant well from the start
Take a broken man right in my hands
And then put back all his parts

And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, girls, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you

Oh, I feel so sorry (I feel so sorry)

Over something you said
I've been holding back tears
While you're throwing back beers
I'm alone in my bed

You know I, I'm afraid of change
Guess that's why we stay the same

All of the things I could not know
