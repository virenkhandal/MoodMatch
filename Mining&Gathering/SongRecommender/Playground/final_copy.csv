Sunday Best,Surfaces,"[Intro: Forrest]
Good, feeling good

[Chorus: Forrest]
Ayy, feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best (Yeah, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 1: Forrest]
Every day can be a better day, despite the challenge
All you gotta do is leave it better than you found it
It's gonna get difficult to stand, but hold your balance
I just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it 'cause

[Pre-Chorus: Forrest]
Everyone falls down sometimes
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
It's okay, uh-huh-huh, uh
It's okay, it's okay

[Chorus: Forrest]
Ayy, feeling good like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best (Ayy)

[Verse 2: Forrest]
Some days you wake up and nothing works, you feel surrounded
Gotta give your feet some gravity to get you grounded
Keep good things inside your ears just like the waves and sound did
And just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it

[Pre-Chorus: Forrest]
Everyone falls down sometimes
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
It's okay, uh-huh-huh, uh
It's okay, it's okay

[Chorus: Forrest]
Ayy, feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best
Ayy, feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed

Ooh
You think I'm nothin' but another fool
I'm better
I'm better than you
I'm like ooh
I can feel it from across the room
Whatever
Whatever I do

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm like, this mothafucka might sue me
And that mothafucka might boo me
I'ma keep on goin' to a better day
All this other bitterness can fade away
It doesn't matter I'm ugly
Keep tellin' me I don't love me
Nothin' in my pocket, but I'm still okay
All I really know is how I feel today

[Chorus]
Ooh, I got a dollar in my pocket
I see you and I really wanna rock it
I'm tryna have some fun at the sideshow
'Cause all that really matters is tonight, so...
Ooh, I got a dollar in my pocket
So turn the music up and get it poppin'
I'm tryna have some fun 'fore I die slow
So all that really matters is tonight

[Verse 2]
Oh
When they play me on the radio
No manners
No manners at all
I'm like oh
If you're feelin' nothin, let me know
Don't matter
It don't matter, I know

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause these days, this mothafucka might kill ya
You act too nice, they won't feel you
Lookin' all around me, but I can't relate
Every day, I'm tryna find a new escape
Everybody's a model
You watch too much, you feel hollow
Nothin' in my pocket, but I'm still okay
All I really know is how I feel today

[Chorus]
Ooh, I got a dollar in my pocket
I see you and I really wanna rock it
I'm tryna have some fun at the sideshow
'Cause all that really matters is tonight, so...
Ooh, I got a dollar in my pocket
So turn the music up and get it poppin'
I'm tryna have some fun 'fore I die slow
So all that really matters is tonight

[Bridge]
Ooh, tonight
I got a feeling for the first time in my life
Ooh, it's a celebration
Thought I would die before I ever felt alright
Ooh, I got a dollar in my pocket
I see you and I really wanna rock it
I'm tryna have some fun at the sideshow
'Cause all that really matters is tonight, so...
Ooh, I got a dollar in my pocket
And even if I never make a profit
I wanna have some fun 'fore my eyes close
So all that really matters is tonight

Ooh, I got a dollar in my pocket
I see you and I really wanna rock it
I'm tryna have some fun at the sideshow

I'm tryna have some fun 'fore I die slow
So all that really matters is tonight

OK,Wallows,"[Verse 1: Dylan Minnette]
I know you so well
You know that I can tell the slightest difference in your facial expression
Don't tell me nothing's on your mind
If we're honest, it will all be fine
I'm someone who likes to talk things through
The hardest thing is getting it out of you
I should sit back and give you a break
Let you close your perfect eyes

[Chorus: Dylan Minnette]
'Cause there's no need to explain
I know what you want to say (Ooh)
We could just say, ""Goodnight"", if you think that's alright
There's no need to explain
I know that we can relate
Can we get up and try to feel okay again?
Okay

[Verse 2: Dylan Minnette]
I'm getting too close
You say you love me most
It's hard to trust it even though I want to
Need to get this shit out of my head
Before I flip this on myself instead
Please come over here
Lay your head right down
Don't make a sound
I hear you loud and clear

[Chorus: Dylan Minnette]
There's no need to explain
I know what you want to say
We could just say, ""Goodnight"", if you think that's alright
There's no need to explain
I know that we can relate
Can we get up and try to feel okay again?
Can we get up and try to feel okay again?
Okay

[Bridge: Dylan Minnette]
If we know we love each other, what's the concern?
Found with or without separation is what I've learned
I'd wait for an hour, or I'd wait for a year
Is your opinion on it something I want to hear?
I know you never lie, but I self-sabotage
I know your love isn't just a mirage
But I tend to panic if I can't reach out and grab it
I need to get out all these bad habits

[Chorus: Dylan Minnette]
There's no need to explain
I know what you wanna say
'Cause you say, ""Goodnight""
If you think that's alright
There's no need to explain
I know that we can relate
Can we get up and try to feel okay again?
Can we get up and try to feel okay again? (Hey)

[Outro: Dylan Minnette]
We can get up and try to feel okay again
We can get up and try to feel okay again

It's in the way you touch me
I don't know much about love

I love it when you say my name real slow
All my love is yours

Ah

[Verse 1]
Gone a little far, gone a little far this time for somethin'
How was I to know? How was I to know this high came rushing?
We're on the borderline, caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Possibly a sign, I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday

There I go
Quite a show for a loner in L.A.​
Askin' how I managed to end up in this place
And I couldn't get away

We're on the borderline, dangerously far and all forgiven
There's gonna be a fight, gonna be a price to pay on Monday (If you and I get comfortable)
We're on the borderline (On the borderline), caught between the tides of pain and rapture

Will I be known and loved? Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up, has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved? Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up, set it free, must be tough
Will I be known and loved? Is there one that I trust?
If there's room, room for doubt, as within, as without ya'
Will I be so in love? Gettin' closer, close enough
Shout out to what is done, R.I.P., here comes the sun
Here comes the sun

[Verse 3]
Gone a little far, gone a little far, this time with something
How could I have known? How was I to know this high came rushing?
I said, ""Come with me outside,"" need to clear my mind, this weight is crushing
Do you see the light, oh, coming from their eyes? Oh no
And I couldn't get away
We're on the borderline (Ooh), gets me every time, these close encounters
Just to know I can (Just to know I can), once again I am alone

Will I be known and loved? Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up, has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved? Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up, set it free, must be tough (I was fine without ya)
Will I be known and loved? L.A. really messed me up
And it isn't cut and dry, conversation, well I tried (I was fine without ya)
Will I be? Stay right here, any closer, bad idea

How you pull up? I pull up (Woo, Seth in the kitchen)

[Chorus: DaBaby]
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar?
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop

[Verse 1: DaBaby]
It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
Know you heard me say, ""You play, you lay,"" don't make me push the button
Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money (Okay, let's go)
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot (Boom)
PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two (two)
Woo, woo

Yeah yeah
How you pull up?

[Verse 2: Roddy Ricch]
Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban
'Cause the codeine had a young nigga swervin'
I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent
And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote-oh-oh-oh

Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car

Well maybe I'm not, heaven knows
It's a spotlight stuck on the ceiling

Could you tell me what's real anymore?

Pacing around, watching my feet
Batteries drain, I get the memo

I found another ex
Some temporary settlement
To kiss the heartbreak off my lips

Is all I could bring me to do

It's nothing like loving you

I’m on my feet so I don't fall for nothing, no-no-nothing
Nothing but you, nothing but you
Honestly, I'm not dumb, and I'm not bluffing
Won't fall for nothing
Nothing but you, nothing but you

Here we go again, what a message we would send
But they heat it up and boil it down to nothing
And they built our homes out of only sticks and stones
And they made damn sure we can't afford the real thing

So we wait for the daylight in the dark night
Like it's all that we know how to do
Inevitably this beating in our chests

When white lies, they call it the truth
It’s the hardest thing they’ve never done
It's nothing like loving you

Honestly, I'm not dumb, and I'm not bluffing
Won’t fall for nothing

This ain't made for the faint-hearted
Come leave your sleeve unguarded
Give me all, give me all, give me all you got
Come finish what we started
This ain't made for the faint-hearted
Come leave your sleeve unguarded now

I'm on my feet so I don't fall for nothing, no-no-nothing
Nothing but you, nothing but you
Honestly, I'm not dumb, and I'm not bluffing
Won't fall for nothing

We'll run right through the flames, let's go (Go)

All white Gucci suit, I'm feeling righteous, yeah
I know that the truth is hard to digest, yeah
Five or six pills in my right hand, yeah
Codeine runneth over on my nightstand
Taking medicine to fix all of the damage
My anxiety the size of a planet (Yeah, ooh)
Holes in my skull, over time
My heart's over ice (Woah, uh)

[Verse 2]
I'm in too deep
Can't swim like me
We're drowning, so I will see
My demons ten feet, under me
Inhale, exhale, but I can't breathe
Too busy drinking codeine doin' high speeds
Crash, pour a four, sip it slow, make the time pass
Take a pill for the thrill, have a relapse
Devil in my head tryna run gym laps
I ain't tryna race, he don't even know me like that

[Chorus]
All white Gucci suit, I'm feeling righteous
I know that the truth is hard to digest
Five or six pills in my right hand
Codeine runneth over on my nightstand
Taking medicine to fix all of the damage

Holes in my skull, over time
My heart's over ice (Woah)

It'll get you up and going out of bed

Yeah, I don't wanna fall asleep, I don't wanna pass away
I been thinking of our future 'cause I'll never see those days
I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect
I been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health
When I leave this earth, hopin' you'll find someone else
'Cause yeah, we still young, there's so much we haven't done
Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son
I wish it could be me, but I won't make it out this bed
I hope I go to heaven so I see you once again
My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings
Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending

I'm happy that you here with me, I'm sorry if I tear up
When me and you were younger, you would always make me cheer up
Taking goofy videos and walking through the park
You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets, sing me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03
Sundays, went to church, on Mondays, watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me

Sea Change,Beck,"She was the one they turned to
When all else had seemed to fail
She was the one who listened
Who gave herself up through it all

Only so much someone can take
Propping up another's dreams
To reach such fame in the eyes of your friends
Surely you were misunderstood

All those secret moments alone
Where you wondered just who you were
All the love you gave seemed from somewhere else
Something learnt, but never real

Letters from sunken, poor lost souls
Who'd misread the look in your eyes
Taking a shot in the dark at your love
Woman you can leave them all behind

Now your pushing yourself even further
Found the strength to aim for higher ground

You are your mother
Your father
Your sister
Your brother
All of them are with you inside

She was the one they turned to
When they needed a woman's voice
She was the one who listened
And gave out the gentle advice

When could you break from the image?
Put aside the perfect face?
Be wrong, be rude, be nasty and cold
Start putting people in their place

Back to the woods where your brother played
Back to the promises your mother made
Back to the room where your sister stayed
Back to the year when you felt the change

You carried weights not all could see
But you put them down and you danced with me
Danced in the summer Danced in the rain
Danced away the past Danced away the pain

Out in the country we stood as the lightening cracked
You told me you had to go on alone and not come back

You are your mother
Your father
Your sister
Your brother
All of them are with you inside
They will never, never, never forget you no they'll never, never, never forget you

When I met you
That night
You were falling down
Desperately searching
For a loving sound
With perfect
Strangers
In an unknown town
We fell in together
Until morning
Came
We looked harder
Together
Look at what we
Found!
Now we are over
We are stronger
Even though we are apart",,,

I'm hoping that you'll come back to me

[Verse 2]
Moving on seems harder to do
When the one that you love moves faster than you
I gave you my all, I showed the proof of your lies
And you weren't worth it, you don't deserve me
As time passes I'm feeling high
You're not the one I'm thinking of tonight
I may not be over you, but I'll try inside
I'm feeling better now, finally feeling special now, oh

[Chorus]
Coasting, roller-coasting
In my emotions, oh
I'll be coasting, roller-coasting
I noticed you weren't the one for me

[Outro]
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
Weren't the one for me
You weren't the one
You weren't the one for me
So don't come back to me, no
No, don't come back to me, no
No, don't come back to me
No, don't come back to me, no
No, don't come back to me
You weren't the one for me

Gaze,Moux,"[Verse 1]

He’s a hero, he’s a hero
Propaganda fake news, you selfish peers pilo
We know, saving face in case the case below
Falls apart and then he knows your name, there’s a sequel
Revenge of the Righteous, light this mic like you’re Nero
Squander his name to maintain fanatic equals
Eco, friendly on the equilibrium brimming under him
Sundered ends prattle, summer friend
Some pretend that he’s a monster, phantom toppler
Doctored, a proctor, keeper of the doctrine
Officer without a badge number to concoct errs
Knocked nerves, scarred and rehearsed, devolving proper
Locker, secret fears framing god as slaughter
Housed an earth with little blot, lopped his head in concert
Conquered, if you ponder rough possibilities he’s already hearing these
Lies

[Verse 2]

He’s a hero, huh?
Knew him post-Messiah complex with the warring drums
Shattered existential dreading driven by mystery lumps
Lauded for the courage, curbin mass hysteria, ya Allah
I knew him before that, chasing cats with cocks intact
Nipped the buds in cul de sacs, cruel weed whacker past entrapped
Acid haps, trippin up on powers hours lacked the graft
Alabast, carving catered futures sutured with a task
Ask, then ye shall receive, ‘cept if you don’t function
Wasted blood in the seas, leave an orphan happily
For a bitch in the cut, right? Politician not the pauper
Lepers don’t sell, aight?
He told me emboldening the smoldering wreck is what he do to protect
Keep the quo quasi for less, leap forward ignore the threats
A pistol loaded regret, I should have stopped his attempts, I should have stopped his attempts
But, we here now
Raging homicidal rhino grinding grottos with a smile
Hollowed hallow hissing, hit me if I’m missing, lift us for we’re kissing
Death has now adjusted for the living",,,

(Pipe that shit up, TnT, LC)

[Chorus]
It was trials and tribulations on the road to chasing that paper
Seen so many faces, been so many places, caught some cases
Crazy thing is, out of all life done taught me
Before you get one win, you gotta take a thousand losses
I remember, nigga, yeah (Straight up, you know me)
How would I ever forget? How could I ever forget? (Yeah, yeah)
I remember, oh, I remember
How could I ever forget? How would I ever forget?

[Verse]
I remember everything, the shine and the struggle
I remember all the pain, all the grind, all the hustle
I remember elementary when pops would come and get me
And take me to the neighborhood with Veneria and Whitney
Then pops had went to prison, I remember every letter
I remember bitches playing with my heart 'cause I would let 'em
I remember what's-his-name told me, ""Bro, let's stick together""
But we couldn't stick together 'cause niggas change just like the weather
I still remember the first night when I met Mr. Raymond
I was on the block with Glocks when Uncle Dereck came to save me
Remember back in middle school when I met Derek Bailey
And he taught me how to sack that weed, stack that cheese, and save it
But I still fucked it up, I remember tryna shake back
Me and Sir Kendrick in the kitchen cookin' fake crack
I remember my first show, I remember who booked me
I remember all you opps from middle school, them niggas was pussy
I remember my first stolen car, I was with Lil Chaz
I had just jumped off the porch, but lil' bruh was moving fast
I remember when I first met Kareem, we was coolin'
A year later, we was breakin' in them houses, shootin' movies
If we catch a nigga late night, no pipe, it's a wrap
We made lil' what's-his-name jump off his bike and that's a fact
Remember when I first caught a buzz with my raps
Money came and niggas changed and stabbed me in my back
Remember when I first confessed my love and I cried
Asked you 'bout that other fuck nigga and you lied
No longer could I stand to see the truth in your eyes
So I went somewhere else to find love and you know why
Remember sitting in my cell blaming the streets
Mama came to see me, said the blame was on me
Remember Lenny died, the city cried for a week
I remember when you niggas testified on Lil C

[Chorus]
It was trials and tribulations on the road to chasing that paper (I remember, I remember, nigga)
Seen so many faces, been so many places, caught some cases
Crazy thing is, out of all life done taught me
Before you get one win, you gotta take a thousand losses
I remember, nigga, yeah
How would I ever forget? How could I ever forget?
I remember, oh, I remember
How could I ever forget? How would I ever forget?",,,

This will all make sense when I am older
Someday I will see that this makes sense
One day when I'm old and wise
I'll think back and realize
That these were all completely normal events
Ah!

[Verse 2]
I'll have all the answers when I'm older
Like why we're in this dark enchanted wood
I know in a couple years
These will seems like childish fears
And so I know this isn't bad, it's good
Excuse me. 

[Verse 3]
Growing up means adapting
Puzzling at your world and your place
When I'm more mature
I'll feel totally secure
Being watched by something
With a creepy, creepy face
Ahhhhh! Ahhhhh!

See, that will all make sense when I am older
So there's no need to be terrified or tense
I'll just dream about a time
When I'm in my age of prime
'Cause when you're older
Absolutely everything makes sense

A tide that is taking me under
Swallowing sand, left with nothing to say

Whenever they try
To shut me or cut me down

Won't tremble when you try it
All I know is I won't go speechless
'Cause I'll breathe
When they try to suffocate me
Don't you underestimate me

You're face-to-face with greatness and it's strange
You don't even know how you feel, it's adorable
Well, it's nice to see that humans never change

Yes, it's really me, it's Maui, breathe it in
I know it's a lot: the hair, the bod
When you're staring at a demigod

Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy!

Hey, what has two thumbs and pulled up the sky
When you were waddling yay high? This guy
When the nights got cold, who stole you fire from down below?
You're looking at him, yo!
Oh, also I lassoed the sun, you're welcome
To stretch your days and bring you fun
Also, I harnessed the breeze, you're welcome
To fill your sails and shake your trees

So, what can I say except ""you're welcome""?
For the islands I pulled from the sea
There's no need to pray, it's okay, you're welcome
I guess it's just my way of being me
You're welcome, you're welcome

[Verse 3]
Well, come to think of it
Kid, honestly, I can go on and on
I can explain every natural phenomenon
The tide, the grass, the ground
Oh, that was Maui just messing around
I killed an eel, I buried its guts
Sprouted a tree, now you've got coconuts
What's the lesson? What is the takeaway?
Don't mess with Maui when he's on the breakaway
And the tapestry here in my skin
Is a map of the victories I win
Look where I've been, I make everything happen
Look at that mean mini Maui just tippity tapping
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hey

[Chorus]
Well anyway, let me say ""you're welcome""
For the wonderful world you know
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome
Well, come to think of it, I gotta go
Hey, it's your day to say ""you're welcome""

I'm sailing away, away, you're welcome

Life is short
When you're done, you're done

Dig a little deeper and you'll know

[Verse 3]
Miss Froggy, might I have a word?
You's a hard one, that's what I heard
Your daddy was a loving man
Family through and through
You your daddy's daughter
What he had in him you got in you

[Chorus]
You got to dig a little deeper
For you it's gonna be tough
You got to dig a little deeper
You ain't dug near far enough
Dig down deep inside yourself
You'll find out what you need
Blue skies and sunshine, guaranteed

[Spoken]
Open up the windows, let in the light chil'en!

[Outro]
Blue skies and sunshine
Blue skies and sunshine
Blue skies and sunshine...
Guaranteed...

I messed up tonight, I lost another fight
I still mess up but I'll just start again
I keep falling down, I keep on hitting the ground
I always get up now to see what's next

Birds don't just fly, they fall down and get up
Nobody learns without getting it wrong

I won't give up, no I won't give in
Til I reach the end and then I'll start again
No I won't leave, I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail

Don't beat yourself up, don't need to run so fast
Sometimes we come last, but we did our best

Til I reach the end and then I'll start again
No I won't leave, I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail

Til I reach the end and then I'll start again
No I won't leave, I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail

You act like you need remindin'
Tryna do it over, bring it back and rewind it
But all that glitters isn't gold, I was blinded
Should have never gave you my heart on consignment

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I can't believe the lies that I went for
Thought you was mine, but you decided to be with him though
You took my feelings and just threw 'em out the window
Feel like it's too hard to fall in love again, no

[Chorus: Kehlani]
On some nights like this, shawty, I can't help but think of us
I've been reminiscin', sippin', missin' ya
Can you tell me what's with all this distant love?
If I called, would you pick it up?
On some nights like this, I just wanna text you, but for what?
You gon' say you want me, then go switch it up
Just gon' play with my emotions just because, no (Oh)

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
All them times I played the fool for you
Thinkin' we could put it back together, thought we had forever
You never see my point of view
Our connection is so severed, you don't show no effort

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I can't believe the lies that I went for
Thought you was mine, but you decided to be with him though
Took my feelings and just threw 'em out the window

You gon' get my hopes high, girl
Just gon' tell me more lies, girl

I've been way too good to you, you take me for granted
You was my day one since back at Big B's house on Adams
First day that we met, I flagged you down, I told you, ""Hit my line""
Used to promise me you'd never switch on me like Gemini
You think I'm a fool, ain't nobody stupid
I see all the signs, I see all the clues
Yeah, sometimes I reminisce 'bout that shit when I'm bingin'
Can't believe it's been a whole year, yeah, but...

On some nights like this, shawty, I can't help but think of us

Lord, please save her for me, do this one favor for me

Won’t fuck you over, wanna fuck you over and again
The truth is I ain't really here to start problems
Girl, I swear to God them hoes can't never say they got him
Know how bad you wanna tell 'em, ""don't try him""
I don't wanna tell 'em, let's surprise 'em
I don't wanna get into it – why you stressin' him? I've been drivin'
Back and forth, from Louisville to Lexington, mileage
On the whip, got your ass in my grip
College make you wanna strip for them dollars
Nah girl, I got a job for you, swear to God I can do a lot for you
Saw you strollin' through the campus, I had to stop for you
I was scrollin' through the 'gram, girl, I had to follow you

When this plane land
I don’t wanna do shit but hold your hand
In the middle of the street like, ""This my man""
Or we can dance to the traffic jam, uh
You can show me 'round town
Show me how it lights up when the sun go down
'Til the waters rise up, then we both drown
In the cover of the night or whatever you like 'cause
I won't be here for too much longer (I won't be here, oh no)
You know I wish I could stay (You know I wish, you know I wish)
Don't tell me not to go, I'm gonna (Don’t tell me not to go)
Fuck around, miss my plane
Fuckin’ round, I'm just playin’, but...

I move light speed so I can't slow down (Why?)
Only got one night in your town (Damn)
I wanna take a dip in your river
Fuck that, I wanna drown
Deep in your water like a fish, love stream (Huh)
How the hell you fit the ocean in your jeans? (Phew)
I'm the only duck swimming in that (Quack)
Hit a big wave then we bick back (Ah)
Pull up in the town then I hit the stage
Rage, then I get the big stacks, ooh
Money make the booty go round (Ooh), lies
Break backs like a broke nigga with a Kit-Kat
Throw the ass out, home run with a big bat
Drive wide load, I don't know where you sit that
Beep, beep, beep
Park that shit right on my lap
Where the hook at?

Losin Control,Russ,"[Chorus]
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

[Verse 1]
She's falling but she doesn't think he'll catch her
'Cause her last relationship was a disaster
Accusations everyday, she didn't know why
All her calls would be ignored, he's on his own time
Should've ended it before it started
All she ever got was broken hearted
He was cheating on her, trying to flip it
Back on her like a victim
Now she all alone and starting over
Now she got baggage on her shoulder
But the new guy really loves her
She loves him, but she doesn't trust herself anymore

[Chorus]
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

[Verse 2]
Despite her past, she can't help the attraction
He tells her that he's nothing like the last one
He redefines in every way what love is
She fell for him and hasn't gotten up since
Every now and then, she goes off, though
Beating on his chest like a bongo
He understands she's coming from a hurt place
Answers all the questions on her survey
Doesn't get jealous, doesn't break trust
Doesn't call her, ""Ho"" after hang-ups
Give her everything she ever wanted
And even though she still feels haunted

[Chorus]
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

The hard part always seems to last forever
Sometimes I forget that we aren't together
Deep down in my heart, I hope you're doing alright
But from time to time I often think of why you aren't mine

[Chorus]
But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do

[Verse 2]
Now, I can't say I'll be alright without you
And I can't say that I haven't tried to
But, all your stuff is gone
I erased all the pictures from my phone
Of me and you
Here's what I'll do

I'll keep your number saved

I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you

To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do

I hope you think of all the times we shared
I hope you'll finally realize I was the only one who cared
It's crazy how this love thing seems unfair
You won't find a love like mine anywhere

But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do
But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you

From Time,Drake,"[Intro: Jhené Aiko]
What's up?
Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star, love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause...

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love

Everything's so different now, you're just what I'm missing now
But I know that I can't have you back, I guess I'm trippin' now

Sometimes I start missin' you crazy, ain't nothing quite like you (yeah)
Love like this keeps goin' and goin', I cannot forget you (no)
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ride around town in a hoopty (uh)
Way before I ever had a groupie (uh)
Back when I used to wear the same five shirts
Way before I ever had Gucci (uh)
Way before I ever had a Rollie on
Talking back when I dropped Corleone
Picking up an eighth that my homie got
Fuckin' in the car, that's the only spot
Back when I felt more free, back when I smoked more weed
Back when I drove up and down 92, with a view of the moon and you in my passenger seat
That was so good, now it's all gone
It is what it is 'cause we both moved on
At least we, have memories, and we also got this song (yeah)

Yeah, if you saw me now
Would you recognize me or would you call me out?
I know it's been a while but I'm still me
But honestly it's been so long that I wouldn't be offended if you didn't even feel me
There's a gap now, big enough to make us forget how we felt in the past now
Everything moves so fast now, damn
I miss things going slower, I miss us being closer
I mean I got a good thing but I feel like I don't even really know her
This a new life, I didn't do you right
But I got a second chance to improve my appreciation, I should take it
I'm sorry that I ever got jaded, for real

Blue Lights,Jorja Smith,"[Intro]
I wanna turn those blue lights into strobe lights
Not blue flashing lights, maybe fairy lights
Those blue lights into strobe lights
Maybe even fairy lights, not blue flashing lights

[Verse 1]
Don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
When you hear the sirens coming
You better not run 'cause the sirens not coming for you
What have you done?
You went to school that day
Was a bit late but it was a Monday
Kept after class for answering back
You apologized, ain't no harm in that

[Chorus]
I wanna turn those blue lights
What have you done
Into strobe lights
There's no need to run
Not blue flashing lights
If you've done nothing wrong
Maybe fairy lights
Blue lights should just pass you by

[Verse 2]
Gun crime into your right ear
Drugs and violence into your left
Default white headphones flooding the auditory
Subconscious waves you accept
You're sitting on the 4 back home
""Where you at, G? Answer your phone!""
Pause the poison to answer his message
Your boy sounds rushed, fears for his adolescence

[Chorus]
I wanna turn those blue lights
What have you done
Into strobe lights
There's no need to run
Not blue flashing lights
If you've done nothing wrong
Maybe fairy lights
Blue lights should just pass you by

[Verse 3]
Tall black shadow as you're getting off the bus
Shadow shows no emotion so what's even the fuss?
But the face of your boy casts a darker picture
Of the red handed act, he's gonna whisper;
""Look blud I'm sorry 'cause I know you got my back
He was running, I couldn't think, I had to get out of that""
Not long ago you were miming to the ""Shook Ones""
Now this really is part two 'cause you're the shook one
Hands you the tool as you question your friendship
How's man like you gonna make me a convict?
Level of a felon when I've done nothing wrong
Blood on my hands but I don't know where it's from, oh
You got blood on your hands but you don't know where it's from

[Bridge]
You better run when you hear the sirens coming
When you hear the sirens coming
Better run when you hear the sirens coming
'Cause they will be coming for you
Run when you hear the sirens coming
Better run when you hear the sirens coming
When you hear the sirens coming
The blue lights are coming for you

[Chorus]
I wanna turn those blue lights
What have you done
Into strobe lights
There's no need to run
Not blue flashing lights
If you've done nothing wrong
Maybe fairy lights
Blue lights should just pass you by

[Outro: Jorja Smith & Dizzee Rascal]
""Blud, when you hear the sirens coming""
Don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
""Blud, when you hear the sirens coming""
Don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
What have you d-d-d-done done
Don't you run
Don't you run
Don't you run when you hear the sirens coming",,,

Fuck him, girl, I guess he didn't know any better
Girl, that man didn't show any effort
Do all I can just to show you you're special
Certain it's your love that holds me together
Lately you say he been killin' the vibe
Gotta be sick of this guy
Pull up, skrr, get in the ride
Left hand is steerin' the other is grippin' your thigh
Light up a spliff and get high
Shawty, you deserve what you've been missin'
Lookin' at you I'm thinkin' he must be trippin'
Play this song for him, tell him, ""Just listen""

[Chorus]
Don't
Don't

[Verse 2]
Girl, said he keeps on playin' games
And his lovin' ain't the same
I don't know what to say, but
What a shame
If you were mine you would not get the same
If you were mine you would top everything
Suicide in the drop switchin' lanes
And that thing so fire, baby, no propane
Got good pussy, girl, can I be frank?
To keep it 100, girl, I ain't no saint
But he the only reason that I'm feelin' this way
Givin' you the world, baby, when you get space
Pen game get me laid, baby, that's penetrate
Oh baby

Don't

H-Town got a nigga so throwed
Pour up, we can party some more
Yeah, got this drank in my cup
Got a young nigga feelin' so throwed
Spit fire in a world so cold
Young money got a nigga feelin' old
Spit fire in a world so cold

Doing It Wrong,Drake,"[Verse 1]
When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

[Chorus]
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you, too

[Bridge]
But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)

[Verse 2]
We live in a generation of not being in love
And not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else

[Chorus]
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you, too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it

You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it

I'm loving your light, vulnerable
Letting your guard down, it's honorable
'Specially when the past ain't been that
Friendly to you, but there’s magic in that
You the flower that I gotta protect
And keep alive in the winter time, ayy, don't you die yet
You been way more than a friend of mine, we more like fam
I raise you, you raise me, let's turn this whole life 'round
You can confide in me
I could take the weight up off your shoulderblades
And try to store the pain inside of me
Ayy, why the world do you like that?
Like they don't know you God-sent, but me, I view you like that
I'm sneaking glances, thanking God that he drew you like that
Beautiful Black child, come and shed your black cloud
For your vibe and your smile, I don't mind a lil' rain
I'm your dog, ears perk up at the sound of your name
Count on your main, wildfire, can't handle your flame
Download your shame, wild high, come drown in your fragrance
You that red pill that a nigga found in the Matrix
Before I had you, this shit was fantasy
You plant a seed to grow some roots, a branch and leaves
Becomes a tree of life until our nights are filled
With peace from stress and strife
And that's the blessing that I get from wifing you
'Cause you entrusted me with the key to your heart
Beating you smart, 'cause even though I need a new start
Due to my past transgressions, you believed in me
I guess the light I see in you is what you see in me, Lord

Might not have always been a fairy tale
But you know and I know that they ain't real

خورشید غروب میکنه و همه میریزن بیرون
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
با لامبورگینی ها و هامر های اجاره شدشون
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown ('Round here)
پارتی شروع میشه، پس اونا دارن میان سمت مرکز شهر (دور و بر اینجا)
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
همه دنبال اینن که سریعتر آماده بشن و برسن به پارتی (ایهام، همه دنبال طلوع و روشنایی خورشید میگردن)
And they wanna know what you're about
و اونا میخوان بدونن که نظر تو چیه
Me in the middle with the one I love and
من و کسی که دوسش دارم وسطای راهیم و ...

فقط داریم تلاش میکنیم که از همه چی سر در بیاریم

I Just Can't Wait to Be King,JD McCrary,"[Verse 1: JD McCrary & John Oliver]
I'm gonna be a mighty king
So enemies beware
Well I've never seen a king of beasts
With quite so little hair
I'm gonna be the main event
Like no king was before
I'm brushing up on looking down
Working on my roar!
Whoa, thus far a rather uninspiring thing
Oh I just can't wait to be king
You have a rather long way to go, young master, if you think—

[Verse 2: JD McCrary, John Oliver & Shahadi Wright Joseph]
No one saying, ""Do this""
Now when I said that—
No one saying ""Be there""
What I meant was—
No one saying, ""Stop that""
No one saying, ""See here""
Now, see here
Free to run around all day
Well that's definitely out
Free to do it all my way

[Verse 3: John Oliver, Shahadi Wright Joseph & JD McCrary]
I think it's time that you and I arranged a heart to heart
Kings don't need advice from little hornbills for a start
If this is where the monarchy is headed, count me out
Out of service, out of Africa, I wouldn't hang about
This child is getting wildly out of wing, Simba
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 4: JD McCrary, Shahadi Wright Joseph & John Oliver]
Everybody look left
Everybody look right
Everywhere you look, I'm standing in the spotlight (Not yet!)
Let every creature go for broke and sing
Let's hear it in the herd, on the wing
It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling
Oh, I just can't wait to be king
Oh, he just can't wait to be king
Oh, I just can't wait (Just can't wait)
To be king!",,,

With staying up till we're sober, wasting money on regrets

And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
(And I'll have to get over you all over again)
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and I
Can't keep going back
I guess it's never really over",,,
Graveyard,Halsey,"[Verse 1]
It's crazy when
The thing you love the most is the detriment
Let that sink in
You can think again
When the hand you wanna hold is a weapon and
You're nothin' but skin

Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running, I keep running, I keep running

They say I may be making a mistake
I woulda followed all the way, no matter how far
I know when you go down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard
Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are

I won't stop 'til I get where you are

We were running onto something
And we didn't say ""forever,"" but it's all we wanted
You were so in love with simple things
And now we're searching for the fire dripped in kerosene
I've been loving more, living less
Off of highs and lows, so obsessed
Couldn't get nothin
But we're never running out

We'll be free spirits, free spirits
Can you hear me calling?
Oh, it's all or nothing
When you're free spirits, free spirits
Can you hear it calling?
'Cause I don't wanna live and die alone, don't let me go

Is this Heaven or Armageddon?
I'll be gettin' high with you to watch the endin'
We were drownin' down our memories
A cemetery full of bottles, man, that liquor bleed
When you're loving more, caring less
It's the highs and lows with no regrets, oh
And we wanted it all then
But we're never running out

We'll be free spirits, free spirits
Can you hear me calling?
Oh, it's all or nothing

Can you hear it calling?

Perfect to Me,Anne-Marie,"[Chorus]
Don't feel like putting makeup on my cheeks
Do what I wanna
Love every single part of my body
Top to the bottom
I'm not a supermodel from a magazine, mmm-mmm
I'm okay with not being perfect
'Cause that's perfect to me
'Cause that's perfect to me
'Cause that's perfect to me

[Verse 1]
No matter where I go, everybody stares at me
Not into fancy clothes, I'm rocking baggy jeans
Getting too close for comfort, but comfort is what I need
So I eat my body weight in chocolate and ice cream
Maybe I bite my nails and don't think before I speak
Don't fit in any crowd, don't ever get much sleep
I wish my legs were bigger, bigger than New York City
And I'll love who I want to love, 'cause this love is gender-free

Don't feel like putting makeup on my cheeks
Do what I wanna
Love every single part of my body

'Cause that's perfect to me
'Cause that's perfect to me

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I wake up late and don't even brush my teeth (Ugh)
Just wanna stuff my face with leftover mac and cheese
You know I get depressed, are you impressed with my honesty?
So I wear what I wanna 'cause I'm cool with what's underneath (Mmm)
I wanna kiss someone that I'll never see again
I wanna go somewhere and go there with all my friends
I wanna take my family to go and see Eminem
'Cause my sister's been in love with him since like we were 10

[Chorus]
Don't feel like putting makeup on my cheeks
Do what I wanna
Love every single part of my body
Top to the bottom
I'm not a supermodel from a magazine
I'm okay with not being perfect
'Cause that's perfect to me
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na (Woo)
'Cause that's perfect to me

I am doin' things, I got a lot of shit to prove now
I was by myself and shit was lookin' greasy
Now you say you need me, but you never believed me
Niggas gon' hate, I tell them that we straight
I'm a young nigga and I came out the 8
Took my brothers outta state, and they doin' time
I wish I could go back and press rewind

I'm makin' a flip (Flip), my life is a flick, come load up the film (Hey)

[Verse 1]
I got me some paper, hired a butler and got me a waiter (Woah)
I wanna get married, but none of my shorties remind me of Jada
Or maybe I'm just too afraid to settle, I wish I was plannin' it different
I think It's a phase, I'm very conditioned
I'm stuck in my ways and scared of commitment, I'm very conflicted (Ooh)
I got the drip and I'm saucy, ooh (Buck, buck, buck)
ADHD, I'm a bad boy
I think I might just pull up in the 'Rari, ooh
I might just skrrt up the Philly
They call me Big Willie, I think I'm Mike Lowrey, ooh
Ain't nothin' much you can tell me, I blew through a milli and threw me a party, ooh (Buck, buck)

[Refrain]
I know I'm the one
Dammit, I made it, I look at my son
I feel like I'm dreamin', he truly a blessin'
I'm really elated, I pray that he grow up like Willow or Jaden
I know that he will
I hope he look up to me like we used to look up to Phil
I know that's it's real
I lay a brick at a time for somethin' I know I can build
I learn it from Will

[Verse 2]
I know ain't nothin' gon' set us back (Buck)
You take it from me, I get it back (Buck, buck)
Me and my homies forever strapped (Buck)
We roll up on 'em like Men in Black (Bah)
I blow your chest through your head and back (Yeah)
I think I done made a mess (Mess)
I'm in Cali with a vest (Hey)
That's the wild wild West (Yeah)
I told my homies I'm good with the labels
I don't need to sign the dots (Yeah)
They must not know me
They cannot control me 'cause I ain't no I, Robot (Hey)
Yeah, I grew up on a legend and I gotta show it
I learned a lot from him and I owe it
Homie's my idol and don't even know it, ooh

[Chorus]
I'm feelin' like Will (Hey), I feel like a prince, I'm feelin' myself (Buck, buck)
I'm loaded with bills (Ooh) 'cause I wasn't blessed with no Uncle Phil (Blah)
Don't know how it feels (Feels), I wanted to flex, they told me to chill (Chill)
I'm makin' a flip (Flip), my life is a flick, now load up the film

[Verse 3]
I'm goin' back to Miami to meet with the cartel (Ooh-ooh)
All of you rappers be runnin' 'round tellin' shark tales (Hey-hey)
I was tryna make a flip when y'all was doin' cartwheels
The Pursuit of Happyness
I was rock bottom now I'm out spendin' large bills (Oh)
And I got a shorty who stuck in a bubble
But I'm still love with her hustle (Ooh)
Her body bangin' but she don't stop talkin'
I wish that she come with a muzzle (Ooh)
I don't know if I'm in love with the pieces
Or I'm just in love with the puzzle (Hey)
But I had to leave her 'cause I know
These girls these days ain't nothin' but trouble (Nothin' but trouble)

[Refrain]
I know I'm the one
Damn it, I made it, now look what I’ve done (Buck, buck, buck)
I feel like I’m dreamin', I count all my blessings
I’m really elated, I know I Am Legend or one in the makin'
I know that it’s real
I hope they look up to me like we used to look up to Phil (Buck, buck, buck)
I know that you will
I lay a brick at a time for somethin' I know I can build (Buck, buck, buck)

[Verse 4]
That's how we leave an impression (Buck)
Yes, I believe in expression (Hey)
I got some secrets and weapons (Buck)
That might just leave a concussion (Ah)
Give me three wishes, I think I'm Aladdin
But there ain't no genie to bless us (Yeah)
I ain't had nothin' just me and heater at night
He be sleep on the dresser (Word)
I cannot fold, I hit all my goals, I did it with pride (Did it with pride)
Ain't nothin' worst than losin' your hero and couldn't say bye (Couldn't say bye)
And we never know just when it's our time
The legends are gone and we don't know why
So before they go, look here go a toast
So give 'em a rose while they still alive (Buck)

I'm feelin' like Will (Hey), I feel like a prince, I'm feelin' myself (Buck, buck)
I'm loaded with bills (Ooh) 'cause I wasn't blessed with no Uncle Phil (Blah)

Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of the body-ody, the ass and titties

I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money (Okay, let's go)
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot

Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote-oh-oh-oh

Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Blue birds fly
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Dreams really do come true ooh ooooh
Someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops that's where you'll find me
Oh somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly
And the dream that you dare to, oh why, oh why can't I?

Well I see trees of green and red roses too
I'll watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

Well I see skies of blue and I see clouds of white
And the brightness of day highlight the dark and I think to myself
What a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people passing by
I see friends shaking hands
Saying, ""How do you do?""
They're really saying, ""I...I love you""
I hear babies cry and I watch them grow
They'll learn much more
Than we'll know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world, world

Someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney top that's where you'll find me
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
And the dream that you dare to, why, oh why can't I? I?",,,

First thing that I'm gonna do
Slide on in some corner booth
And take the whole damn family out
Buy my buddies all a round
Pay some extra on the tab
Catch a movie, catch a cab
Watch a ball game from the stands
Probably over-wash my hands

Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long til I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then

Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you

You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as Guitar Town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know
Well you should know that I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio

[Chorus]
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you

[Outro]
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
Still chasing you, still chasing you",,,
So Will I,Ben Platt,"[Verse 1]
You say ""What if I go crazy?""
I say ""That ain't gonna happen""
You say ""What if I get lost?""
I say ""You'll just find your way back""
And you say ""What if someone breaks my heart?""
“I'll put it back together like I do”
You say ""What if I don't catch the dreams
That I've been out there chasing?
What if when my fears show up
I'm too afraid to face them?""
Well, I can't fight your battles
But I sure can hold your hand and promise you

[Chorus]
That the sky will still be up there
And the sun will always shine
The stars will keep on fallin'
For the ones who wish at night
The mountains won't start moving
And the rivers won't run dry
The world will always be there
And so will I
(Will I, will I)
(Will I, will I)

[Verse 2]
You say ""What if things start changing?""
I say ""We'll be changing with ‘em
We'll just sing a different melody
And dance at different rhythm""
You say ""What if I give up?""
I say ""That's one thing that I'll never let you do""
You say ""What if someone leaves me
And they leave me empty-handed?""
I say ""Losing only teaches you
To not take things for granted
No, I can't just bring 'em back
But darling, I can hold your hand and promise you""

[Chorus]
That the sky will still be up there
And the sun will always shine
The stars will keep on fallin'
For the ones who wish at night
The mountains won't start moving
And the rivers won't run dry
The world will always be there
And so will I

[Post-Chorus]
(Will I, will I)
(Will I, will I)
So will I, I (Will I, will I)
Oh I (Will I, will I)
And so will I (Will I, will I)
I, oh I (Will I, will I)
I, and so will I (So will I, so will I)
I (So will I, so will I)

[Outro]
Even if the sky is fallin'
And the sun don't want to shine
If the stars we used to wish on
Disappear into the night
Well, I can move a mountain
But only by your side
Just say you'll always be there
I know you'll always be there
And so will I",,,

We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it

Does To Me (feat. Eric Church),Luke Combs,"[Verse 1: Luke Combs]
I was a third-string dreamer on a second-place team
But I was hell on wheels with a full head of steam
When coach put me in
And I'm still proud of that hit
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week
No, I didn't get lucky
But I still felt like a king
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Verse 2: Luke Combs]
I was the one phone call when my brother went to jail
Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail
No, I'll never get it back
But I'm okay with that
I was the first man standing next to my best friend
The day the love of his life said ""I do"" to him
I was a couple beers deep
But I still remembered that speech
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover

But it does to me

So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show

Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head

I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone

[Pre-Chorus]
But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I

Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?

So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless

Was never the right time, whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all

So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

[Bridge]
Would we be better off by now
If I'd have let my walls come down?
Maybe, I guess we'll never know
You know, you know

Before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said

I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect
I been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health
When I leave this earth, hopin' you'll find someone else
'Cause yeah, we still young, there's so much we haven't done
Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son
I wish it could be me, but I won't make it out this bed

I'm happy that you here with me, I'm sorry if I tear up
When me and you were younger, you would always make me cheer up
Taking goofy videos and walking through the park
You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets, sing me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03
Sundays, went to church, on Mondays, watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me

I got everything I wanted

It might've been a nightmare

When you're talkin' like that, girl?""

Girl, just kiss me

Break My Heart,Dua Lipa,"[Verse 1]
I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like

I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?

I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home

Death By A Thousand Cuts (Live From Paris),Taylor Swift,"[Chorus]
Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
Get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Verse 1]
I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know""
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
So  if the story's over, why am I still writing pages?

[Chorus]
'Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
Get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Verse 2]
My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you too much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts

[Chorus]
Get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
No, it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Post-Chorus]
Part of me that you didn't touch
My body, my love, my trust
But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no

[Outro]
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know""",,,
If the World Was Ending (feat. Julia Michaels),JP Saxe & Julia Michaels,"[Verse 1]

[H.E.R., Niall Horan & Keith Urban]
I was distracted and in traffic
I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', were you out drinkin'?
Were you in the living room, chillin', watchin' television?
It's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to let you go and let communication die out

You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant

If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight

[Pink Sweat$, Jordan Davis, Sasha Sloan & Anne-Marie]

It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', the night we went drinkin'
Stumbled in the house and didn't make it past the kitchen

Ah, it's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out

Daylight (Live From Paris),Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
But now I see daylight
I only see daylight

[Verse 2]
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
So I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things I'm never gonna say)
Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
But now I see daylight
I only see daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

[Bridge]
And I can still see it all in my mind
All of you, all of me intertwined
I once believed love would be black and white
But it's golden golden
And I can still see it all in my head
Back and forth from New York, sneaking in your bed
I once believed love would be burning red
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, like daylight

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things I'm never gonna say)
Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
But now I see daylight
I only see daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

You gotta step into the daylight and let it go

God Whispered Your Name,Keith Urban,"[Verse 1]

And nothing seemed to ring true
I couldn't bear the cross
For everything I'd been through
And each day, I knew I needed change
But there was no way, no way

And then God whispered your name
And that's when everything changed
And love came out of the rain
And talk about being saved
Suddenly I wanna live
More than I ever did
I'm never gonna be the same
When God whispered your name

I can see the sunshine
For the first time in a while
Girl, it's like I've been baptized
By the warmth of your smile, hmm
Well, call it fate or faith or call it crazy either way

That's when everything changed
Love came out of the rain
Talk about being saved
Well, suddenly I wanna live

Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind

She know I'm a call away, she can drop a pin and I'd come meet her
Stand next to me, you gon' end up catchin' a fever (Yeah, yeah)

Someone You Loved,Lewis Capaldi,"[Verse 1]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Bridge]
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

[Chorus]
For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved",,,
Everything I Wanted,Billie Eilish,"[Verse 1]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

[Verse 2]
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03

Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me

Does To Me,Luke Combs Featuring Eric Church,"[Verse 1: Luke Combs]
I was a third-string dreamer on a second-place team
But I was hell on wheels with a full head of steam
When coach put me in
And I'm still proud of that hit
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week
No, I didn't get lucky
But I still felt like a king
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Verse 2: Luke Combs]
I was the one phone call when my brother went to jail
Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail
No, I'll never get it back
But I'm okay with that
I was the first man standing next to my best friend
The day the love of his life said ""I do"" to him
I was a couple beers deep
But I still remembered that speech
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

There's a worn-out blade that my granddaddy gave me
My mama's first Bible, Daddy's Don Williams vinyl
That first-fish-catching Zebco thirty-three

So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving average Joe (Average Joe)
But I'm a hell of a lover

Now it just feels like it's wearing and stretching

From people that never could stare at reflections (Ooh)
Somewhere in there is a lesson

Me and the Cardinals are sharing a section (Facts)
Gotta cherish the present

After A Few,Travis Denning,"[Verse 1]
I probably shouldn't have said hello
When I saw you out with your friends
I know I should've left it alone
When I caught you looking

[Pre-Chorus]
A little smile, a little how you been
A little touch, a little reminisce
It always starts off innocent

[Chorus]
But after a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh, after a few

[Verse 2]
We always take it way too far
Where it's too much to resist
We always make it way too hard
To walk away after that third kiss

[Pre Chorus 2]
We pretend that we'll be fine
Through the sting of the morning light
'Cause it happens every time

[Chorus]
After a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh yeah, after a few

[Bridge]
Little smile, little how you been
Little touch, little reminisce
We both know how it ends

[Chorus]
After a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh, after a few",,,

Heart been broke so many times I don't know what to believe
Mama say it’s my fault, it's my fault, I wear my heart on my sleeve
Think it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice ’cause I can't breathe
I'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice, it's gettin' the best of me

[Verse]
While in the cell with Lil' Hakeem, after I slapped him I had told him
""I don't know how you get down with them clowns but I'm a soldier""
No one could understand, I had way too much aggression
That built over the years from my abandoned adolescence
See I done been lied to, backstabbed, and heartbroken
I wanted to cry but I was too afraid to open
Prayin’ one day I’d find a peace of mind by the ocean
I spent all my time committing crimes to get closer
While at my nana house I play the couch, starin' at the ceiling
Tryin’ not to get in my feelings
Thinkin' of a way I could make these millions
Maybe that'll take this pain away and clear up all these rainy days, yeah

Heart been broke so many times I don't know what to believe
Mama say it’s my fault, it's my fault, I wear my heart on my sleeve

I was broke, now I'm rich, these niggas salty

All this designer on my body got me drip, drip, ayy
Straight up out the Yajects, I'm a big Crip
If I got a pint of lean, I'ma sip, sip
I run the racks up with my queen like London and Nip
But I got rich on all these niggas, I didn't forget, back
I had to go through the struggle, I didn't forget that
I hopped inside of the Maybach and now I can sit back
These bitches know me now 'cause I got them big racks
'Cause I'm gettin' money now, I know you heard that
Young nigga on the corner, bitch, I had to serve crack
Uncle fronted me some P's, had to get them birds back
We came up on dirty money, I gave it a birdbath
Cut off the brain and I give my bitch a new coupe

Got a New Orleans bitch and man, that pussy voodoo

These ain't no Guess jeans
I dropped out of school, I'm still good at math, but, nigga, don't test me
I played to the left, they went to the right, they tried to finesse me
Still riding 'round with that blicky, I hope they don't catch me
Police had raided our spot, so we went to the next street
Play like I'm dumb, as soon as it pop, I'm goin' retarded
He say I'm hard and he say I'm garbage, I'm rich regardless
We in Miami in the middle of the winter, and we on them jet skis
If we in Atlanta, I'm runnin' the 'Cat and I'm workin' the red key

I cannot mention my homies inside of my song 'cause I know they be trappin' a lot
I can't keep takin' these pills, when I'm in the trenches, they say I be cappin' a lot
I know a nigga who say he got rich off the dope, but I know he be actin' a lot
I know some niggas who said that they took down the city, but niggas be lackin' a lot
Yeah
That shit was awful, nigga had that dog food
That day they shot you, I slid on a Mongoose
You cannot come back around me, you turned your back on me, I cannot forget
The police was lyin', they say that they caught you, but nigga, they made you admit
Your name was found, you put in that work, they took your stick, you a bitch
Fuck my opps, they be on my dick, they all be mad we rich (Turn up)

[Verse 3: Polo G]
Uh
These rappers really nice as hell
I'm a different nigga when I'm pissed off
Man, he say he gon' press up on who?
I'ma get the steel like I'm Chris Paul
Back to back suburbans, I'm a big dawg
I was in the slums servin' Fentanyl
Zombieland, junkies havin' withdrawals
I been gettin' to it, lotta missed calls
Turn it off, what the fuck is he talking 'bout?
I should slap you for sayin' he hot as me
I don't know who could fuck with me honestly
They know I'm the man, so they watchin' me
Different color bands like Monopoly
Man, he must not be usin' his head
If he thinkin' I don't keep a Glock with me
That's like suicide if you play with us
Got a better chance at the lottery
Call an ambulance when that chopper sweep
Make the crowd dance, choreography
Once I got a plan, ain't no stoppin' me
Three-car garage, million-dollar crib
With a foreign bitch ridin' on top of me
Lot of people done said I wouldn't be shit
Well, I guess they owe me an apology

These ain't no Guess jeans

I been tryna reach for it, but it's too far above me
I ain't never do you wrong, so tell me why you don't trust me
She don't do this often, she said it's only because me
You the one who want it, therefore you can never judge me
She just wanna party and nothing's wrong with that
Every time I'm calling, she say she gon' call me back
I told her call me Rocky, she say she not gon' call me that
You say you come with a lot, well, baby, I want all of that

[Chorus]
Lil' mama a party girl, she just wan' have fun too
They say you ain't wifey type, but I don't care, I want you
She like to do drugs too, she in love with guns too
They say you too piped up, but I think that I love you
Lil' mama a party girl, she just wan' have fun too
They say you ain't wifey type, but I don't care, I want you
She like to do drugs too, she in love with guns too
They say you too piped up, but I think that I love you

[Chorus]
All white Gucci suit, I'm feeling righteous, yeah
I know that the truth is hard to digest, yeah
Five or six pills in my right hand, yeah
Codeine runneth over on my nightstand
Takin' medicine to fix all of the damage
My anxiety the size of a planet (Yeah, ooh)
Holes in my skull, over time
My heart's over ice (Woah)

[Verse 1]
Over ice, I'm freezing
Beautiful eyes, deceiving
We may die this evening
Coughing, wheezing, bleeding
High, I'm an anxious soul
Blood moons are my eyes, stay low
Red and black, they glow
Under attack, in my soul
When it's my time, I'll know
Never seen a hell so cold
Yeah, we'll make it out, I'll know
We'll run right through the flames, let's go (Go)

I'm in too deep
Can't swim like me
We're drowning, so I will see
My demons ten feet, under me
Inhale, exhale, but I can't breathe
Too busy drinking codeine doin' high speeds
Crash, pour a four, sip it slow, make the time pass
Take a pill for the thrill, have a relapse
Devil in my head tryna run gym laps
I ain't tryna race, he don't even know me like that

[Chorus]
All white Gucci suit, I'm feeling righteous
I know that the truth is hard to digest
Five or six pills in my right hand
Codeine runneth over on my nightstand
Taking medicine to fix all of the damage

Holes in my skull, over time

Need round two, I need a sequel
Hit the backboard like a free throw
You next level, you a cheat code
In so deep, you hit my seafloor
Got me singing like Alicia
Got me using all your lingo
Tell your girlfriend that you single
Call me over 'cause I go hard
Sweet lil' bih, fuck like a pornstar
Next day, act just like your road dog
Bitches askin' how you know her
Head game stupid, baby loca
Too loud, callate la boca
Out this world, you supernova
Fuck that, I am coming over

Shawty, you know you can always stop by
You top five and no, you're not five
And not four, three, or two, but one, girl
I'm hot now, wanna see what's under
The access easy in a sundress
Your accent's leaking on my tongue, yes
You're badder than the song that's sang from Mike Jack
I made you cum and you came right back
You calling me upon a late night
I got you leaking like a brake pipe
Swimming in your sea, just like a diver
I'm in it, just creeping like a Great White
And I might fuck you in your own car
You ride my face just like a pornstar
I'm in it so deep, just caught a broke jaw
And I just want one thing, that's a phone call

And spent fifty on all the guys
All of these hoes in these stores make commission
And plus I'ma tip 'em, they holdin' my size
Get in your car and just put on your flashers
And follow the hearse since you say you gon' ride
'Cause somebody gon' die if they fuck with us
Turn a five to a dime, that's a double up
Fuck around, walk through church with my double cup
This shit a habit, I'm prayin' I give it up
Tiger stay with the wood, make 'em give it up
Know I ran through a mil' every week coppin' weed
Bruh beat the charge, I can get me some sleep
Got a backend to pick up, I won't even leave

Emotionally Scarred,Lil Baby,"[Verse 1]
A love letter came through the mail, it said, ""I miss you""
I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue, try to forget you
I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OG's salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, ""Of course""
I just played the hand that I was dealt, didn't have to force
All around the world they know it's me, they hear my voice

All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend
I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz
I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?
I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew? Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that up to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people
I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming
Watched my lil' boy play with toys, I just dropped a tear of joy
Some shit that I feel for
I been going crazy with that scoring, call me Baby Harden

[Chorus: NAV]
Took twenty bitches on my first vacay
I ain't pickin' up, I'm in Turks, lil' baby
Every other watch got diamonds in the face
Pullin' out, ask to take a taste, lil' baby
Pullin' out fifty racks, walkin' out of Chase
If I drop dead, I'll be hard to replace
Hardly get thirsty, got water like a lake
My brother got locked, another bond I gotta pay",,,
If The World Was Ending,JP Saxe Featuring Julia Michaels,"[Verse 1]

[H.E.R., Niall Horan & Keith Urban]
I was distracted and in traffic
I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', were you out drinkin'?
Were you in the living room, chillin', watchin' television?
It's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to let you go and let communication die out

[Pre-Chorus]

[FINNEAS & Alessia Cara]
I know, you know, we know you weren't
Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't
Meant for each other and it's fine

[Chorus]

[Jason Derulo, Kesha, Zara Larsson & Alessia Cara]
But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant

[Kelsea Ballerini, Sam Smith & The Rose]
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye

If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?

[Verse 2]

[Pink Sweat$, Jordan Davis, Sasha Sloan & Anne-Marie]
I tried to imagine your reaction
It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', the night we went drinkin'
Stumbled in the house and didn't make it past the kitchen

[Anne-Marie & Noah Cyrus]
Ah, it's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out

[Pre-Chorus]

I know, you know, we know you weren't
Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't

Si el mundo se acaba, ¿tú vendrías, verdad?
Los dos cayendo con la gravedad

More Hearts Than Mine,Ingrid Andress,"[Verse 1]

Walk you 'round the foothills of my town
Probably feel like you've been there before
After hearing all the stories I've been telling you
For six months now

Pack a shirt for church, because we'll go

I just thought that we should talk
A few things out before we hit the road

If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Take you fishin', but pretend that he don't like you
Oh, if we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine

[Verse 3]
My sister's gonna ask a million questions
Say anything she can to turn you red
And when you meet my high school friends
They'll buy you drinks and fill you in
On all the crazy nights I can't outlive

So if I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Buy you dinner, but pretend that he don't like you
Oh, if we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine

Oh
Mmh

If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She feels every heartache I go through
And if my dad sees me cryin'
He'll pour some whiskey over ice and
Tell a lie and say he never really liked you
Oh, if we break up I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine
You'll be breaking more hearts than mine",,,

I had you stayin' too close to the city, you actin' too vulnerable livin' this life

How the fuck you keep so many secrets?
How you goin' vegan, but still beefin' with me again?
How the fuck you've seen so many beaches?
Tickets to them places don't come cheap, and
I see you back in Turks
Remember who took you there first and don't you forget it
Got you a whip, but then you got back on your shit
I had to tell Eric go get it
I'm always movin' too fast, the feeling don't last
I feel like you take me for granted
Probably my fault for the way that I handle it

Ooh, shawty, you tried it
Voice gettin' filled with entitlement
Why would you tell me those lies? And
Why would you make it so bold to my face?
Why are your stories all over the place?
Whole lotta secrets friends don't keep safe
Where did your friends all go? (Woo)
I can't solve your problems
You say your problems never needed solvin'
I was too good to you, should've stayed solid
Nice guys always finish off where they started

Déjà vu, I wanted smoke and I got it
Déjà vu, déjà
Déjà

Right outside, TT

Cut 'em off, make 'em feel it, I ain't dealin' with nothin' if it don't make sense to me (Never ever, ever)

Lately I feel like it's me versus me, don't see competition, why would you compete? (Huh?)

Can't get the hood outta me, you know where I be (Where?) Still posted up like I lease (Now)
Trust me, them choppers gon' bang, cavity teeth, you better not think this shit sweet (Splat)
If the bitch bad put a stack in her rack (Go)
I'm Dr. Seuss, give me cat in the hat (Woah)
Booty poke out and her stomach on snatch
Way to pretty to be fucked from the back (Ugh)
Count up some money then smoke me a plant
This shit got me higher than Ja Morant (Up there)
Toxic lil' bitch and she knowin' she that
I said I was done, still doubled back
If you a side bitch you can not question me
You did some foul shit, you threw a TEC at me
Cook it up right, they done gave me the recipe
I'm in a Z06, police ain't catchin' me
I'm still duckin' this bitch that's obsessed with me
'Cause I'm the dope like the coke in the '70s
Big body double R truck, I got Bo with me
Hoggin' the lane, now they can't get close to me (Big bag)

Check the thermostat, I've been hot four summers (Hot)
Try me, you get whacked, make it hard for your mama
Moneybagg Runtz in the pack, get a bundle
Plaque and the sack, both of 'em doing numbers
I ain't got a heart for a ho, that's a big no (No go)
No-life worry 'bout the next ho (Why, though?)
Took back the keys to the Benzo
All in her feelings, throwin' clothes out the window (Psycho)
Let's take a AK, cut it in half and call it a Draco (Let's go)
I'm back on my old ways, ridin' with that five, volcano that fuego
Life insurance on my chain (Your life)
Reach for it, bust your brain (Night, night)
Loose noodle, no lo mein (Take out)
Going out the way I came (Same route)

I ain't ever ran from a nigga (No I ain't never, ever), if I did, cut my legs off (Right now)

Drinking Alone,Carrie Underwood,"[Intro]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1]
Let me make one thing clear
You can buy me a beer, but you ain't taking me home
No pick up lines, I came here tonight to shed a few tears on my own
But sitting there across the room
I couldn't help but notice you seem a little down on your love too
Yeah, my heart might be breaking
But, this seat ain't taken
And you've got me thinkin'

[Chorus]
We should be drinking alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
We should be drinking alone, together (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2]
I don't know what she did to make you hurt like this
But, I know just what to do
It starts with a bottle of good Reposado
And ends with a shooter or two
Tomorrow when the sun comes up
Tonight’s the night that never was
Baby, just forget my name
Won't be your one and only
But just 'cause we're lonely, don't mean that we should

[Chorus]
We should be drinking alone
'Cause drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone
Drinking alone, drinking alone (Together)
Maybe we shouldn't be drinking alone (We should be drinking alone)
Drinking alone, drinking alone
Baby, we shouldn't be drinking alone

[Bridge]
I'll pretend that I care
Baby, pull up a chair
We'll stay here 'til they make us go home

[Chorus]
We should be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, we should be drinking alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone (Drinking alone, drinking alone) together
Maybe we shouldn't be drinking alone (We should be drinking alone)
Drinking alone, drinking alone
Baby, we shouldn't be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1]
I pour an eight inside the Lam' truck, fell asleep flyin'
I thought them niggas had my back, but I'm steady seein' signs
And I can't turn my back on Boona like I ain't see him tryin'
These tears shed, whenever he dead, it's different seein' him die
Bah, get close up on 'em, you know that shit be graphic
You gotta pop out with that ratchet, you know this shit get tragic
And you can't fumble with that stick, you know this shit ain't Madden
All that shit you did in the streets, you know that shit gon' vanish
Yeah, I pop these pills, they try to read my thoughts
And you can't dig back in your past 'cause you got time you lost
And make that time up for your kids 'cause you know time ain't bought
Booka bought me a diamond cross, but he know he won't cross me
They turned they back and said they'd kill me, yeah, that's when they lost me
I put baguettie inside the Cartier 'cause I'm feelin' bossy
They feel some type of way in the county jail, I told 'em call me
I built a relationship with the real with niggas who never saw me
Yeah, I seen my chance and that's when I grabbed it
Fuck bein' a hundred, I spent a couple hundred on niggas' tablets
Lean gave me chest pains, that's when I popped the Perky tablet
I tried to get that family vibe for niggas who wasn't established
You do that shit again, what you did to bro gon' get you a casket
I did shit for niggas without them askin'
I broke pounds for niggas without them matchin'
I don't fuck with you, I'ma tell y'all nah even though I got it

Yeah

This shit was different, we was together like ten years ago
And I don't talk to a lotta niggas, but they still the bros
The ones I ain't talk to like that back then, know they still hoes
And some niggas try to hide they hate, but that shit still show
I never fucked on block hoes because I call 'em sisters
One hate me right now as I speak because I called her a hooker
Cut the loose ends, I cut 'em off, they try to say I'm a butcher
Bitch, you a rat, never mind, I changed my life, I'm Muslim
I talked to Chops on FaceTime, he say, ""Damn, you back smokin'""
He say, ""That back door damn near closed,"" I say, ""It's back open""
I say, ""These blocks could be back one,"" he say, ""You back hopin'""
You gotta watch them niggas you love 'cause they still backdoorin'
He ain't got no hope in beatin' his trial because he lost his motion
Bro got life, he don't know how pussy smell, that's why he fuck his lotion
I know some real niggas would lose it all for a viral moment
My dreads swing, I feel like Wayne, show me my opponent

[Outro]
You know, I like talkin' to the streets, like
When you say you the voice, you gotta, like, open up, like
Tell motherfuckers, like, what it is, like, you can't hold nothin' back
You gotta relate to them, relate to the poverty, you know what I'm sayin'?
Relate to the trenches
You know what I'm sayin', I can't be talkin' 'bout a Richard Mille all the time, know what I'm sayin'?
Some of the guys don't even know what the fuck a Richard Mille is
Know what I'm sayin'? You gotta relate
All angles, know what I'm sayin'?

Where I grew up, gettin' dressed up means
Buttoned down shirt and a good pair of jeans
Wasn’t Sunday supper without collard greens
Dad was boss, Christ is king
Friday night was livin' for them lights to come on
Then I turned to Miller Lites when I turned 21
There's some things about me that I can’t change
I'll always be the man that home made

Home made me love a dirt road

I'm in this bitch with the Wooski
Ball in the summer like Drew League
Champagne got me loopy
Glizzy Bop lookin' groovy
All the demons lookin' moody (What?)
All the demons lookin' moody

[Verse 1: Drake & Fivio Foreign]
Skrrt 'round there in your ends, whole southside on ten
Not like them, make men lean out Benz
That's how a man get blem, you and your friends
This Hermés from runway, this ain't Ralph Lauren
Tell them again, loved her way back when
Drunk so I type ""Je t'aime"" but don't hit send
Send some bread to the pen
All my G's are blessed, we check in for them
Whole lotta charges laid to this day
No confessions for them
Man really feel no ways, these man waste
No progression for them
Think you're bad, just wait, food get ate
And that's just lessons for them
Sosa (Sosa), Fivi (Fivi), lookin' like KD and Kyrie (I am)
My TD Bank is on what? (What?)
My TD Bank is on Kylie (Ayy, ayy)
Tribeca in the lobby, all these niggas gettin' dodgy (Baow)
When we see 'em, it's a body (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Chorus: Drake & Fivio Foreign]
Fivi (Fivi), Sosa (Sosa), viral (Viral), movie (Movie)
I'm in this bitch with the Wooski (I am)
Ball in the summer like Drew League
Champagne got me loopy (Baow)
Glizzy Bop lookin' groovy (Baow)
All the demons lookin' moody
(All the demons lookin' moody)
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 2: Fivio Foreign]
Move (Move), get out the way (Get out the way, lil' bitch), uh
Say the wrong thing, you'll get shot in your face (Baow, yeah)
Fivi (Fivi), laced (Laced), I put the opps in they place (Opp)
Yeah, if you a gangster, then you gotta relate (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
She got a face that you cannot mistake
She paid for the food and we went on a date
Head game great, huh, she let me nut on her face, ayy, ayy, ayy
Uh, every time she link, she come with an eighth (Baow)
Viral, you ain't never make a movie with Drake (Baow)
Sponsor (Sponsor), I take a Perc, now I'm turned to a monster (Turned to a monster)
Uh, I'm in the court like ""I'm sorry, your honor"" (I'm sorry, your honor, lil' bitch, baow)
I killed the opp, but I ain't catchin' no karma (Baow, baow)
Yeah, I killed the opp, but I ain't catchin' no karma (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Chorus: Drake, Fivio Foreign & Sosa Geek]
Fivi (Fivi), Sosa (Sosa), viral (Viral), movie (Movie)

All the demons lookin' moody (Ayy, look)
Ayy, ayy

[Verse 3: Sosa Geek]
Bitch, I'm a demon in the night
And I'm a shark up underwater (I am)
I got shooters in New York
And I got shooters across the border (What?)
I call Drake and tell him off 'em (Drake)
Ayy, I call Drake and tell him off 'em (What?)
If they Woo walk, I probably taught 'em (I did)
I got the money, they say that I'm gifted
Fuck sale, so I'm givin' out gift stamps (I am)
Highway, me and Fivio lifted (What?)
London, man, I need me a thick bitch (A thick)
And a Louis bag just so I can fit me the grip in (Grip)
I got the swag, so tell me the difference
Mike Amiri, best believe they fitted
She wanna fuck, but I ain't with it
Headshot, knock him off his fitted
Punch him out, send that boy to that dentist
Talkin' Henny, it better be Privilège, ayy
Baow, what?
It better be Privilège

[Chorus: Drake & Fivio Foreign]
Fivi, Sosa, viral, movie
I'm in this bitch with the Wooski
Ball in the summer like Drew League
Champagne got me loopy
Glizzy Bop lookin' groovy
All the demons lookin' moody (What?)
All the demons lookin' moody
Ayy, ayy",,,
July,Noah Cyrus & Leon Bridges,"[Verse 1: Noah Cyrus]
I've been holding my breath
I've been counting to 10
Over something you said
I've been holding back tears
While you're throwing back beers
I'm alone in my bed

[Pre-Chorus: Noah Cyrus]
You know I, I'm afraid of change
Guess that's why we stay the same

[Chorus: Noah Cyrus & Leon Bridges]
So tell me to leave
I'll pack my bags, get on the road
Find someone that loves you
Better than I do, darling, I know
'Cause you remind me every day
I'm not enough, but I still stay

[Verse 2: Leon Bridges]
Feels like a lifetime
Just tryna get by
While we're dying inside
I've done a lot of things wrong
Loving you being one
But I can't move on (Oh, I)

[Pre-Chorus: Leon Bridges]
You know I, I'm afraid of change
Guess that's why we stay the same

[Chorus: Leon Bridges]
So tell me to leave
I'll pack my bags, get on the road
Find someone that gives you
All of the things I could not know
'Cause I keep fighting all the way
I let you down so I could stay

[Bridge: Noah Cyrus & Leon Bridges, Both]
If you want me to leave
Then tell me to leave and, baby, I'll go
And, baby, I'll go

[Outro: Noah Cyrus & Leon Bridges]
You remind me every day
I'm not enough, but I still stay",,,
