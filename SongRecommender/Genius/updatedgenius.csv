Times We Had,Barlito,"[Chorus: Barlito]
Remember the times we had
The times that you and me had
Remember the times we had
The times that you and me had
Remember the times we had
The times that you and me had (It's Zesty, bitch)

[Post-Chorus: Barlito]
Reminiscin' 'bout the time when you wasn't by my side
Everything was going fast, baby girl, you didn't last
Yeah, you had me in my bag
The times that you and me had

[Verse 1: JuJu]
Don't tell me you gon' ride for me, I know that you lied to me
All my niggas doin' things 'cause we stuck in poverty
Don't tell me that you love me and you wanna fuck me
And you know me, nigga, I'm money-hungry
Niggas know what I do now, I'm stuck in the booth now
I am doin' things, I got a lot of shit to prove now
I was by myself and shit was lookin' greasy
Now you say you need me, but you never believed me
Niggas gon' hate, I tell them that we straight
I'm a young nigga and I came out the 8
Took my brothers outta state, and they doin' time
I wish I could go back and press rewind
I thought you said you loved me, why you say you hate me?
I was in your guts 'til you said you movin' shaky
Baby, please don't hate me, I just want your baby
You could be my lady, just stop movin' wavy

[Chorus: Barlito]
Remember the times we had
The times that you and me had
Remember the times we had
The times that you and me had (JayHollywood)

[Verse 2: JayHollywood]
I thought you was just for me, findin' you not for me
I'm missin' you, baby, I'm missin' your company
When you sad, you come to me, I love you, you stressin' me
Fuckin' up my heart, keep fuckin' messin' with me
I don't even know now, rappin', singin' songs now
Wanted me after I made it, baby, you a dub now
I've been by my lonely, actin' like they know me
Think we goin' too fast, baby, take it slowly
I think 'cause I miss you, that song, think I dissed you
She suckin' my dick, said, huh, so she can kiss you
I'm fuckin' your love, ooh, ah, baby, do you love me?
I just wanted your hugs, ooh, ah, tried to play me
Baby, now you a dub, don't wanna see you no more
Baby, I'm askin' you, where did you go?
You better not let go, ride for me, don't hide from me
I'm bein' straight up, so you shouldn't have lied to me
Bein' with me, obviously, that you gon' really ride for me, woah

[Pre-Chorus: Barlito]
Yeah, I got me a Patek, imagine having you in my bed
While you was playing with my head, you was acting hard to get

[Chorus: Barlito]
Remember the times we had
The times that you and me had

[Verse 3: Eli Staxxz]
Baby, man, I'm telling you, just keep it a buck
I'm just tellin' you, baby, I do not want you, wanna fuck
And I got you and I'm gettin' money, gettin' hella bucks
And I'm with all my niggas, I'm tellin' you, we keep this truck
If a nigga pull up, swear to God we got the fuckin' bang
If a nigga pull up, swear to God, I'm shooting, yeah, that's bang
And I pull up with my niggas and you know we gon' murk
Yeah, your feelings hurt and I'm goin' off on the dirt
And I'm tellin' you, my nigga, yeah, I came from the bottom
These niggas all be talkin', yeah, the problems, yeah, I solve 'em
'Cause I be goin' crazy, nigga, yeah, I'm so legit
Yeah, these bitches fuckin' hate me, nigga, tell me I ain't shit
But I'm tellin' you, my nigga, yeah, that shit is my hobby
I pull up and, you already know, shoot everybody

How you pull up, Baby? How you pull up? (Oh, oh, oh)
How you pull up? I pull up (Woo, Seth in the kitchen)

[Chorus: DaBaby]
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar?
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop

[Verse 1: DaBaby]
It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
Know you heard me say, ""You play, you lay,"" don't make me push the button
Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money (Okay, let's go)
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot (Boom)
PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two
And I'll kill another nigga too
'Fore I let another nigga do somethin' to you
Long as you know that, don't let nobody tell you different
Daddy love you (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: DaBaby & Roddy Ricch]
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar?
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo, yeah)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Roddy Ricch]
Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban
'Cause the codeine had a young nigga swervin'
I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent
And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote

[Chorus: DaBaby]
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar?
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)

I been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health
When I leave this earth, hopin' you'll find someone else

I'm happy that you here with me, I'm sorry if I tear up
When me and you were younger, you would always make me cheer up
Taking goofy videos and walking through the park
You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets, sing me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03
Sundays, went to church, on Mondays, watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me

That's how we leave an impression (Buck)
Yes, I believe in expression (Hey)
I got some secrets and weapons (Buck)

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Let me check my chest, my breath right quick (Ha)
He ain't ever seen it in a dress like this (Ah)
He ain't ever even been impressed like this
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip
Like it, love it, need it, bad
Take it, own it, steal it, fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy? (Hot)
Shut it, save it, keep it pushin'
Why you beating 'round the bush?
Knowin' you want all this woman
Never knock it 'til you try (Yah, yah)
All of them bitches hating I have you with me
All of my niggas sayin' you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of the body-ody, the ass and titties

[Chorus]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so"
