[Verso 1: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Yeah
Uh-la-la, junto a la piscina, cantábamos mientras bailando
Dos no-noches con una vista, sí
Manteniendo las persianas cerradas (Sí)
Ella dijo, ""Quiero encontrar a alguien antes del anochecer""
Uh-na-na, ¿podrías ser tú?
Baby, me gustas

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Oh, mirándola mover, me perdí en los ritmos
Y ella me agarró de cerca por la mirada en sus ojos
No sé su nombre, pero sé que la necesito
Ella dijo, ""Hombre, no te vas a sentir solo está noche""

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Ella dijo, ""Uh-uh-uh""
Bésame como tu ex novio estuviera en el cuarto
No tengas miedo de probar algo nuevo
Si lo haces bien, puedes ser alguien
Sí, alguien que
No me deje solo está noche

[Post-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Sí, sí, sí
Sí, sí, sí
Sí

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Uh-la-la, haz algo, yeah, baby, antes de la última oportunidad
Luna llena noche con las luces apagadas
Baby, tus oos lucen (Sí)
No sé por qué pero me siento como voy a volver (Loco)
Uh-la-la, si está bien
Sí, baby, me gustaría

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Oh, mirándola mover, me perdí en los ritmos
Y ella me agarró de cerca por la mirada en sus ojos (Sí)
No sé su nombre, pero sé que la necesito
Ella dijo, ""Hombre, no te vas a sentir solo está noche""

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Ella dijo, ""Uh-uh-uh"" (Uh-uh-uh)
Bésame como tu ex novio estuviera en el cuarto (Uh-uh-uh)
No tengas miedo de probar algo nuevo
Si lo haces bien, puedes ser alguien
Sí, alguien que (Sí)
No me deje solo está noche

[Verse 2: KAROL G]
Caliente, te pongo caliente (Ah)
No te de miedo vivir algo diferente (Eh, eh)
Las ganas no se equivocan (-vocan; eh)
Pon tu lengua en mi boca (Boca; eh)
Vive la vida loca, loca, loca, ah

[Pre-Chorus: KAROL G]
Toda la noche bailando contigo
Suave y salvaje como un animal
Yo sé que te gusta, pero esto es prohibido
Yo me voy contigo, dame la señal

[Chorus: Joe Jonas, KAROL G & Nick Jonas]
Ella dijo, ""Uh-uh-uh"" (Uh-uh-uh)
Bésame como tu ex novio estuviera en el cuarto (Uh-uh-uh)

One Margarita,Luke Bryan,"[Verse 1]
Everybody here ain't from here
But we're here doin' our thing
Lettin' go a little, little by little
Sippin' on a frozen drink

[Pre-Chorus]
Tiki bars tik'n, pourin' all weekend
Clouds ain't leakin' no rain
Two pieces shakin', white caps a-breakin'
We ain't feelin' no pain, it goes like

[Chorus]
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
""Hey, Señorita, don't you think we need a salt and a Buffett song?""
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita
We'll be gone

[Verse 2]
Ice blue skies, shades on the eyes
To tuck the bloodshot away
Hair of the dog, shouldn't take long
But who cares, we got all day
Palm trees a-leanin', sunburn screamin'
But we'll all be alright, after

[Chorus]
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
""Hey, Señorita, don't you think we need a salt and a Marley song?""
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita
We'll be gone

[Post-Chorus]
We'll be gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Tiki bars tik'n, pourin' all weekend
Clouds ain't leakin' no rain
Two pieces shakin', white caps a-breakin'
We ain't feelin' no pain, feelin' no pain
It goes like

[Chorus]
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
""Hey, Señorita, don't you think we need a salt and a Chesney song?""
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita
We'll be gone

[Post-Chorus]
We'll be gone
We'll be gone"
Blinding Lights,The Weeknd,"[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
The city's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

[Bridge]
I'm just coming back to let you know (Back to let you know)
I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (Ooh)

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

[Outro]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch"
I Dare You,Kelly Clarkson,"[Verse 1]
There's a wolf that preys on a world that strays so far from the Garden (Oh)
And just like your own, every heart you know seems cold and hardened (Oh)
You may not have the stage, but you still have a voice
You may not have the strength, but if you have a choice

[Chorus]
I dare you to love
Oh, I dare you to love
Even if you're hurt and you can only see the worst
Even if you think it's not enough
Oh, I dare you to love

[Verse 2]
We're all full of hope, tryna stay afloat, tryna save one another
People let you drown 'cause they don't know how to stay above water
When they're too broken to know what they've put you through
Do the only thing that you'd want done to you

[Chorus]
Oh, I dare you to love (Dare you to love)
Oh, I dare you to love (I dare you to love)
Even if you're hurt and you can only see the worst (Oh)
Even if you think it's not enough
Oh, I dare you to love

[Post-Chorus]
I dare you to love, oh

[Bridge]
You may not have the stage, but you still have a voice
You may not have the strength, but if you have a choice

[Chorus]
I dare you to love, even if you can't
No, I dare you to love
Oh, even if you're hurt and you can only see the worst (Only see the worst)
Even if you think it's not enough
Oh, I, I dare you

[Outro]
I dare you
Oh, I, I dare you to love"

Nobody But You (feat. Gwen Stefani),Blake Shelton,"[Verse 1: Blake Shelton, Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani]
Don't have to leave this town to see the world
'Cause it's something that I gotta do
I don't wanna look back in 30 years
And wonder who you're married to
Wanna say it now, wanna make it clear
For only you and God to hear
When you love someone, they say you set 'em free
But that ain't gonna work for me

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani]
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna even breathe
I don't wanna dream about you
Wanna wake up with you next to me
I don't wanna go down any other road now
I don't wanna love nobody but you
Lookin' in your eyes now, if I had to die now
I don't wanna love nobody but you
You

[Verse 2: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani]
All the wasted days, all the wasted nights
I blame it all on being young
Got no regrets 'cause it got me here
But I don't wanna waste another one
I been thinkin' about what I want in my life
It begins and ends the same
If I had to choose what I couldn't lose
There'd only be one thing

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani]
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna even breathe
I don't wanna dream about you
Wanna wake up with you next to me
I don't wanna go down any other road now
I don't wanna love nobody but you
Lookin' in your eyes now, if I had to die now
I don't wanna love nobody but you
You
I don't wanna love nobody but you (You)

[Bridge: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani]
Wanna say it now, wanna make it clear
For only you and God to hear

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani, Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani]
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna even breathe
I don't wanna dream about you
Wanna wake up with you next to me (Next to me)
I don't wanna go down any other road now
I don't wanna love nobody but you (I don't wanna love nobody)
Lookin' in your eyes now, if I had to die now
I don't wanna love nobody but you
You
I don't wanna love nobody but you (You)
I don't wanna love nobody but you"
ROCKSTAR (feat. Roddy Ricch),DaBaby,"[Intro: DaBaby]
Woo, woo
I pull up (pull up)
Like
How you pull up, Baby? How you pull up? (Oh, oh, oh)
How you pull up? I pull up (Woo, Seth in the kitchen)

[Chorus: DaBaby]
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar?
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop

[Verse 1: DaBaby]
It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
Know you heard me say, ""You play, you lay,"" don't make me push the button
Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money (Okay, let's go)
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot (Boom)
PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two (two)
Woo, woo
I pull up like
Yeah yeah
How you pull up?

[Chorus: DaBaby & Roddy Ricch]
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar?
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo, yeah)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Roddy Ricch]
Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban
'Cause the codeine had a young nigga swervin'
I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent
And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: DaBaby]
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar?
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Glock, Glock, Glock, Glock)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop (chop, chop, chop, chop)

[Outro]
Woo, woo
Go get the chop (chop, chop, chop, chop)
Woo, woo
Go get the chop (chop, chop, chop, chop)"

Daisies,Katy Perry,"[Verse 1]
Told them your dreams, and they all started laughing
I guess you're out of your mind 'til it actually happens

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm the small town
One in seven billion
Why can't it be me?

[Chorus]
They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

[Verse 2]
When did we all stop believing in magic?
Why did we put all our hopes in a box in the attic?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm the long shot
I'm the Hail Mary
Why can't it be me?

[Chorus]
They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down (Knock me down)
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

[Bridge]
Hey, hey
Oh, cover me in daisies
Hey, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm the small town
One in seven billion
Why can't it be me?

[Chorus]
They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out (Count me out)
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies"

We could be miles apart
But you know I'm never too far
My friend, until we meet again

I'm feelin’ like Will (Hey), I feel like a prince, I'm feelin' myself
(Buck, buck)

I'm makin' a flip (Flip), my life is a flick, now load up the film (Hey)

[Verse: Will Smith]
Yeah
You feelin' like me? (Whoa)
I feel like a prince that turned to a king (Ayy)
Found me a queen, started a family and got me a team
On top of my dreams, Joyner, I know you inspired by me
Like I was inspired by Nelson Mandela, I give him a rose for every endeavor
And shoutout to Julius Erving, one of the legends I worship (Worship)
Muhammad Ali put the work in, he was the champ, the greatest, he earned it
I love that you think that I'm perfect but I had plenty mistakes and burdens
My grandmama thought I was worth it
She always guided me when I was searchin’ (Searchin’)
I wouldn't be me if it wasn’t for her (I wouldn't be Will)
I wouldn't be Willie, I couldn't be me if there wasn’t no Eddie
I wouldn't be Will if I wasn't from Philly
Ain't nothin' much that you really can tell me
Willie been cold since Benny and Jerry
Must've forgot that I really get busy
They done forgot who invented ""Get Jiggy,"" ayy (They must have forgotten)
Back before there was streaming sales
Way before all the iTunes and the fans had to get CDs still (Hey)
Sixty million records sold, I was on fire, I ain't even need a grill
Did it all with no cuss words, I ain't have to curse just to keep it real (Woo)
Me and Jazz in the late eighties, writin' rhymes, makin' tapes daily
Fresh Prince make the babes crazy, rest in peace to James Avery
Even when the streets call me corny I still ain't never let the hate break me
I just wanted the respect first, I still ain't never let the fame change me (Yeah)
New me, but I'm old school (Old school)
Big Willie on the Pro Tools (Pro Tools)
Still fresh and I'm so smooth (So smooth)
I still got on my old shoes
I give Jada one thousand kisses, ain't nothin' change since '02 (Ayy)
Martin Lawrence get a rose too
He a legend and a G.O.A.T.  too (G.O.A.T. )
Man, I love how you break the rules
Pushin' limits and you make it cool
Joyner Lucas wasn't made to lose
You a legend in the makin' too
What a beauty, my life's a movie
I swear I'm only on take two
All my kids turned out great and I know your son gon' be great too (Great too)
Brick by brick, buildin' a wall that no one could break
Flip by flip, glad I could help so you could be straight
And life's a trip, but who could relate?
The legends are gone but it ain't too late
To give 'em a rose and carry the grace
'Cause not every hero is wearin' a cape (Will)

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
I'm feelin' like Will (Hey), I feel like a prince, I'm feelin' myself
(Buck, buck)
I'm loaded with bills (Ooh) 'cause I wasn't blessed with no Uncle Phil (Blah)
Don't know how it feels (Feels), I wanted to flex, they told me to chill (Chill)
I'm makin' a flip (Flip), my life is a flick, mm"

I'm the hood Mona Lisa, break a nigga into pieces

Bitch, that's my trash, you the maid, so you bagged him, ah

[Chorus]

Bitch, what's happening? (Ayy, ah)

[Verse 2]
Eat me and record it, but your edge-up all I'm showing (Ah)
I keep my niggas private, so his AP all I'm showing (Baow)
Beefing with you bitches really getting kinda boring
If it ain't about the money, then you know I'm gon' ignore it
I'm the shit, ooh (Ayy)
I need a mop to clean the floor, it's too much drip, ooh (Too much drip, ooh)
I keep a knot, I keep a watch, I keep a whip, ooh (I keep a whip, baow)
Let's play a game, Simon says I'm still that bitch, ayy (Still that bitch)
I'm still that bitch, yeah (Ah)

[Chorus]
I'm a savage
Classy, bougie, ratchet (Yeah)
Sassy, moody, nasty (Yeah)

Don't let that nigga gas you up and get you whacked, ooh

You Say,Lauren Daigle,"[Verse 1]
I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I’m not enough
Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
Remind me once again just who I am, because I need to know

[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe

[Verse 2]
The only thing that matters now is everything You think of me
In You, I find my worth; in You, I find my identity

[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe

[Bridge]
Taking all I have and now I'm laying it at Your feet
You have every failure, God
You'll have every victory

[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe

[Outro]
Oh, I believe
Yes, I believe
What You say of me
Oh, I believe"

Somewhere Over the Rainbow / What a Wonderful World,Israel Kamakawiwo'ole,"'Kay, this one's for Gabby

Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Blue birds fly
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Dreams really do come true ooh ooooh
Someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops that's where you'll find me
Oh somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly
And the dream that you dare to, oh why, oh why can't I?

Well I see trees of green and red roses too
I'll watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

Well I see skies of blue and I see clouds of white
And the brightness of day highlight the dark and I think to myself
What a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people passing by
I see friends shaking hands
Saying, ""How do you do?""
They're really saying, ""I...I love you""
I hear babies cry and I watch them grow
They'll learn much more
Than we'll know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world, world

Someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney top that's where you'll find me
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
And the dream that you dare to, why, oh why can't I? I?"
Hard to Forget,Sam Hunt,"[Intro]
There stands the glass
That will ease all my pain
That will settle my brain
It's my first one today
There stands the glass
That-that will ease all my pain
That-that will settle my brain
It's-it's my first one today

[Verse 1]
Ayy
I saw your sister at work
I saw your mama at church
I'm pretty sure I saw your car at the mall
I see your face in the clouds
I smell your perfume in crowds
I swear your number's all my phone wants to call

[Pre-Chorus]
It's kinda funny how I can't seem
To get away from you
It's almost like you don't want me to

[Chorus]
You've got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey, but I got no proof
That you showed up tonight
In that dress just to mess with my head
So much for so long
Out of sight, out of mind
Girl, you're lookin' so good
It's drivin' me out of mine
Oh, you're breakin' my heart
Baby, you're playin' hard to forget

[Verse 2]
Told me to leave all your things
Out on the porch, on the swing
You'd come and grab 'em by the end of the week
Well, it's just some jeans and a shirt
But it's a whole lot of hurt
I think I know why you've been dragging your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't it funny how I can't seem
To get away from you?
It's almost like you don't want me to

You've got a cold heart and the cold hard truth

Fucked up like a rockstar, riding in a cop car

Everybody said that I'm falling, uh
Took another line, I'm calling, uh
I'm so sick of the nonsense, uh
I'ma dive into the mosh pit, uh
I don't really think I'm the problem
I don't really think it's a problem
Me plus me is a problem
One gunshot could solve 'em
Tell my friends I'm sorry though
T-T-T-Tell my sins to go

Keep shoutin' and screamin'

Six Feet Apart,Luke Combs,"[Verse 1]
When the dogwoods start to bloom
And the crickets hum their tune
That's usually about the time
That I feel most alive
But the news has all been bad
And the whole world seems so sad
I ain't had much else going on
So I sat down and wrote this song

[Chorus]
I miss my mom, I miss my dad
Miss the road, I miss my band
Giving hugs and shaking hands
It's a mystery, I suppose
Just how long this thing goes
But there'll be crowds and there'll be shows
And there will be light after dark
Some day when we aren't six feet apart

[Verse 2]
First thing that I'm gonna do
Slide on in some corner booth
And take the whole damn family out
Buy my buddies all a round
Pay some extra on the tab
Catch a movie, catch a cab
Watch a ball game from the stands
Probably over-wash my hands

[Chorus]
I miss my mom, I miss my dad
Miss the road, I miss my band
Giving hugs and shaking hands
Well, it's a mystery, I suppose
Just how long this thing goes
But there'll be crowds and there'll be shows
And there will be light after dark
Some day when we aren't six feet apart

[Chorus]
I miss my mom, I miss my dad
I miss the road, I miss my band
Giving hugs and shaking hands
Well, it's a mystery, I suppose
Just how long this thing goes
But there'll be crowds and there'll be shows
And there will be light after dark
Some day when we aren't six feet apart

There will be light after dark
Some day when we aren't six feet apart"
Sunday Best,Surfaces,"[Intro: Forrest]
Good, feeling good

[Chorus: Forrest]
Ayy, feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best (Yeah, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 1: Forrest]
Every day can be a better day, despite the challenge
All you gotta do is leave it better than you found it
It's gonna get difficult to stand, but hold your balance
I just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it 'cause

[Pre-Chorus: Forrest]
Everyone falls down sometimes
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
It's okay, uh-huh-huh, uh
It's okay, it's okay

[Chorus: Forrest]
Ayy, feeling good like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best (Ayy)

[Verse 2: Forrest]
Some days you wake up and nothing works, you feel surrounded
Gotta give your feet some gravity to get you grounded
Keep good things inside your ears just like the waves and sound did
And just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it

[Pre-Chorus: Forrest]
Everyone falls down sometimes
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
It's okay, uh-huh-huh, uh
It's okay, it's okay

[Chorus: Forrest]
Ayy, feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best

Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best"
Memories,Maroon 5,"[Chorus]
Here's to the ones that we got

Rise Up,Andra Day,"[Verse 1]
You’re broken down and tired
Of living life on a merry-go-round
And you can’t find the fighter
But I see it in you so we gonna walk it out
And move mountains
We gonna walk it out
And move mountains

[Chorus]
And I’ll rise up
I'll rise like the day
I’ll rise up
I'll rise unafraid
I'll rise up
And I’ll do it a thousand times again
And I’ll rise up
High like the waves
I’ll rise up
In spite of the ache
I'll rise up
And I’ll do it a thousand times again

[Post-Chorus]
For you
For you
For you
For you

[Verse 2]
When the silence isn’t quiet
And it feels like it’s getting hard to breathe
And I know you feel like dying
But I promise we’ll take the world to its feet
And move mountains
Bring it to its feet
And move mountains

[Chorus]
And I’ll rise up
I'll rise like the day
I’ll rise up
I'll rise unafraid
I'll rise up
And I’ll do it a thousand times again

[Post-Chorus]
For you
For you
For you
For you

[Bridge]
All we need, all we need is hope
And for that we have each other
And for that we have each other
We will rise
We will rise
We’ll rise, ohh ohhh
We’ll rise

[Chorus]
I’ll rise up
Rise like the day
I’ll rise up
In spite of the ache
I will rise a thousands times again
And we’ll rise up
High like the waves
We’ll rise up
In spite of the ache
We’ll rise up
And we'll do it a thousands times again

For you ohhhh ohhh ohh ohhh ohh
For you ohhhh ohhh ohh ohhh ohh
For you ohhhh ohhh ohh ohhh ohh"
Chasin' You,Morgan Wallen,"[Verse 1]
We used to chase that Chattanooga freight
Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long til I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then

[Chorus]
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you

[Verse 2]
You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as Guitar Town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know
Well you should know that I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio

[Chorus]
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you

[Outro]
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
Still chasing you, still chasing you"
So Will I,Ben Platt,"[Verse 1]
You say ""What if I go crazy?""
I say ""That ain't gonna happen""
You say ""What if I get lost?""
I say ""You'll just find your way back""
And you say ""What if someone breaks my heart?""
“I'll put it back together like I do”
You say ""What if I don't catch the dreams
That I've been out there chasing?
What if when my fears show up
I'm too afraid to face them?""
Well, I can't fight your battles
But I sure can hold your hand and promise you

[Chorus]
That the sky will still be up there
And the sun will always shine
The stars will keep on fallin'
For the ones who wish at night
The mountains won't start moving
And the rivers won't run dry
The world will always be there
And so will I
(Will I, will I)
(Will I, will I)

[Verse 2]
You say ""What if things start changing?""
I say ""We'll be changing with ‘em
We'll just sing a different melody
And dance at different rhythm""
You say ""What if I give up?""
I say ""That's one thing that I'll never let you do""
You say ""What if someone leaves me
And they leave me empty-handed?""
I say ""Losing only teaches you
To not take things for granted
No, I can't just bring 'em back
But darling, I can hold your hand and promise you""

[Chorus]
That the sky will still be up there
And the sun will always shine
The stars will keep on fallin'
For the ones who wish at night
The mountains won't start moving
And the rivers won't run dry
The world will always be there
And so will I

[Post-Chorus]
(Will I, will I)
(Will I, will I)
So will I, I (Will I, will I)
Oh I (Will I, will I)
And so will I (Will I, will I)
I, oh I (Will I, will I)
I, and so will I (So will I, so will I)
I (So will I, so will I)

[Outro]
Even if the sky is fallin'
And the sun don't want to shine
If the stars we used to wish on
Disappear into the night
Well, I can move a mountain
But only by your side
Just say you'll always be there
I know you'll always be there
And so will I"

Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it, but
We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it

When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter

Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good

Call it dumb luck, but baby, you and I
Can't even mess it up, yeah, though we both tried
No, it don't always go the way we planned it
But the wolves came and went and we're still standing

When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same

Will blow right over while we stay put

Ooh
Ooh 

[Verse 1]
Yeah,  I'm a turner
I turn pages all the time
Don't like where I'm at
34  was bad, so I just turn to 35
Yeah,  I'm a keeper
I keep digging down for the deep
Like  the records I'm playing
They might keep you waiting
But you know I'm only playing for keeps

[Chorus]
And if the house just keeps on winning
I  got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm a giver
Yeah, and I'm still giving 'em hell
Forgiving's pretty hard
So I made an art out of forgettin' 'em well
Yeah, I'm a rhymer
I can turn 20 cents into a 10
And if I get confused and I start to lose
I rhyme a dime 'til it all makes sense

[Chorus]
And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I turn a light on in my soul
And keep a bluebird in my heart

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Ooh

[Chorus]
And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love starts giving me lemons
Just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart
Keep a bluebird in my heart

And treat this night like it'll happen again
You'll be my bloody valentine tonight

I'm lyin' naked with you, yeah
In my head, in my head
I'm ready to die holding your hand

Does To Me (feat. Eric Church),Luke Combs,"[Verse 1: Luke Combs]
I was a third-string dreamer on a second-place team
But I was hell on wheels with a full head of steam
When coach put me in
And I'm still proud of that hit
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week
No, I didn't get lucky
But I still felt like a king
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Verse 2: Luke Combs]
I was the one phone call when my brother went to jail
Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail
No, I'll never get it back
But I'm okay with that
I was the first man standing next to my best friend
The day the love of his life said ""I do"" to him
I was a couple beers deep
But I still remembered that speech
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Bridge: Eric Church]
There's a worn-out blade that my granddaddy gave me
My mama's first Bible, Daddy's Don Williams vinyl
That first-fish-catching Zebco thirty-three
Well, that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Chorus: Luke Combs & Eric Church]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving average Joe (Average Joe)
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And I'm a damn hard working
One thing's for certain
I stand up for what I believe (For what I believe)
That might not mean much to you
But it does to me
Yeah, it does to me
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

Oh, it does to me
Oh man, it does to me"

Cornelia Street (Live From Paris),Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
""I rent a place on Cornelia Street""
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home

[Chorus]
And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

[Verse 2]
Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone

[Pre-Chorus]
But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I

[Chorus]
I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'll never walk Cornelia Street again

[Bridge]
You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen

[Chorus]
I hope I never lose you
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh, never again
‘Cause baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

Shut it, save it, keep it pushin'
Why you beating 'round the bush?

Never knock it 'til you try (Yah, yah)

All of my niggas sayin' you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of the body-ody, the ass and titties

Turn that frown into a smile real quick
There ain't nothing that a beer can't fix

Drink it down, it will do the trick

Before You Go,Lewis Capaldi,"[Verse 1]

It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless

Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Bridge]
Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me, what you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
It's only me, let it go

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away"
I Hope,Gabby Barrett,"[Verse 1]
I, I hope she makes you smile
The way you made me smile on the other end of a phone
In the middle of a highway driving alone
Oh baby I, I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along and gets you thinking about her
Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah

[Chorus]
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me

[Verse 2]
Yeah then I hope she shows up in a 2 am pic from her friend
Hanging on to a guy and you just ain't him
I hope you stay up all night all alone waiting by the phone
And then she calls
And baby I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget and take her on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss

[Chorus]
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me

[Bridge]
I hope what goes comes all the way around
I hope she makes you feel the same way
About her that I feel about you right now

[Chorus]
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
Like you did on me"
My Wish,Rascal Flatts,"[Intro]
Ooh

[Verse 1]
I hope that the days come easy and the moments pass slow
And each road leads you where you wanna go
And if you're faced with a choice and you have to choose
I hope you choose the one that means the most to you
And if one door opens to another door closed
I hope you keep on walkin' 'till you find the window
If it's cold outside
Show the world the warmth of your smile
But more than anything
More than anything

[Chorus]
My wish, for you, is that this life becomes all that you want it to
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small
You never need to carry more than you can hold
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to
I hope you know somebody loves you
And wants the same things too
Yeah, this is my wish

[Verse 2]
I hope you never look back, but you never forget
All the ones who love you, in the place you left
I hope you always forgive, and you never regret
And you help somebody every chance you get
Oh, you find God's grace in every mistake
And always give more than you take
But more than anything (More)
Yeah, more than anything

[Chorus]
My wish, for you, is that this life becomes all that you want it to
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small
You never need to carry more than you can hold
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to
I hope you know somebody loves you
And wants the same things too
Yeah, this is my wish
Yeah, yeah

My wish, for you, is that this life becomes all that you want it to
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small
You never need to carry more than you can hold
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to
I hope you know somebody loves you
And wants the same things too
Yeah, this is my wish (My wish, for you)

[Outro]
This is my wish (My wish, for you)
I hope you know somebody loves you (My wish, for you)
May all your dreams stay big (My wish, for you)"

everything i wanted,Billie Eilish,"[Verse 1]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

[Verse 2]
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

[Outro]
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?"
Tennessee Whiskey,Chris Stapleton,"[Verse 1]
Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I'd known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back from bein' too far gone

[Chorus]
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

[Verse 2]
I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart, I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothin' like your love to get me high

[Chorus]
And you're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

[Outro]
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey"
I Hope You’re Happy Now,Carly Pearce & Lee Brice,"[Verse 1: Carly Pearce with Lee Brice]
It's all on me, it's my mistake
I said ""I don't love you"" a little too late
But I guess there ain't ever a right time
And I don't know why it's called a goodbye
Go run my name into the ground
Tell everyone you know just how
How I slammed the door on our forever
But I promise you it's for the better

[Chorus: Carly Pearce & Lee Brice]
I hope you find what you were looking for
I hope your heart ain't hurting anymore
And you get moving on, all figured out
And you don't hate me somehow
'Cause I hope you're happy now

[Verse 2: Lee Brice with Carly Pearce]
Who knew this heart could break this hard
Or a love like ours could fall apart
Without so much as a warning
I thought that I was what you wanted

[Chorus: Lee Brice & Carly Pearce, Lee Brice]
Well I guess you found what you were looking for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothing left
And so I hope you're happy now

[Chorus: Carly Pearce & Lee Brice, Carly Pearce]
I hope you find what you were looking for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
Hope you get moving on, all figured out
And you don't hate me somehow
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothing left
So I hope you're happy now

Happy now
Oh, I hope you're happy now

The Box,Roddy Ricch,"[Chorus]
Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em fuck 12, fuck SWAT
Bustin' all the bells out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in the box, mmh
Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo deals, we been trappin' like the '80s
She sucked a nigga soul, gotta Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know where you at, at

[Verse 1]
I was out back where the stash at
Cruise the city in a bulletproof Cadillac (Skrrt)
'Cause I know these niggas after where the bag at (Yeah)
Gotta move smarter, gotta move harder
Nigga try to get me for my water
I'll lay his ass down, on my son, on my daughter
I had the Draco with me, Dwayne Carter
Lotta niggas out here playin', ain't ballin'
I done put my whole arm in the rim, Vince Carter (Yeah)
And I know probably get a key for the quarter
Shawty barely seen in double C's, I bought 'em
Got a bitch that's looking like Aaliyah, she a model
I got the pink slip, all my whips is key-less
Compton, I'm about to get the key to the city
Patek like the sea, forgive me

[Chorus]
Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em fuck 12, fuck SWAT
Bustin' all the bells out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in the box, mmh
Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo deals, we been trappin' like the '80s
She sucked a nigga soul, gotta Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know where you at, at, hah

[Verse 2]
Hahaha, I been movin' 'em out
If Steelo with me, then he got the blues in the pouch (Yeah)
Took her to the forest, put the wood in her mouth
Bitch, don't wear no shoes in my house
The private I'm flyin' in, I never wan' fly again
I'll take my chances in traffic (Yeah)
She suckin' on dick, no hands with it
I just made the Rollie plain like a landing strip
I'm a 2020 president candidate
I done put a hundred bands on Zimmerman, shit
I been movin' real gangster, so that's why she picked a Crip
Shawty call me Crisco 'cause I pop my shit
Got it out the mud, there's nothin' you can tell me, yeah
When I had the drugs, I was street wealthy, yeah

[Chorus]
Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em fuck 12, fuck SWAT
Bustin' all the bells out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in the box, mmh
Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo deals, we been trappin' like the '80s

Be Kind,Marshmello & Halsey,"[Verse 1: Halsey]
Wanna believe, wanna believe
That you don't have a bad bone in your body
But the bruises on your ego make you go wild, wild, wild, yeah
Wanna believe, wanna believe
That even when you're stone cold, you're sorry
Tell me why you gotta be so outta your mind, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
I know you're chokin' on your fears
Already told you I'm right here
I will stay by your side every night

[Chorus: Halsey]
I don't know why you hide from the one
And close your eyes to the one
Mess up and lie to the one that you love
When you know you can cry to the one
Always confide in the one
You can be kind to the one that you love
Ah

[Verse 2: Halsey]
I know you need, I know you need
The upper hand even when we aren't fighting
'Cause in the past, you had to prepare every time, yeah
Don't wanna leave, don't wanna leave
But if you're gonna fight, then do it for me
I know you're built to love, but broken now, so just try, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
I know you're chokin' on your fears
Already told you I'm right here
I will stay by your side every night

[Chorus: Halsey]
I don't know why you hide from the one
And close your eyes to the one
Mess up and lie to the one that you love
When you know you can cry to the one
Always confide in the one
You can be kind to the one that you love

I know it's hard for you, but it's not fair
Going sick in the head, tryna get you there
And I know it's hard for you, but it's not fair
It's not fair

I don't know why you hide from the one
And close your eyes to the one
Mess up and lie to the one that you love

Always confide in the one
You can be kind to the one that you love

When you know you can cry to the one
Always confide in the one

Do It,Chloe x Halle,"[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Yeah, I beat my face
Moving fast 'cause the Uber on the way
Taking pictures, make sure you can't see no lace
That wig secure like the money in the safe
I look like bae
Now I'm on the way
Let you know when I'm 'bout a mile away
When I'm outside, please don't make me wait
The party starting when we pull up to the gate
Girl, we so late

All of Me,John Legend,"[Verse 1]
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out
You've got my head spinnin', no kiddin'

What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright

My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around
Through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing
In my head for you

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's under water, but I'm breathin' fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

[Bridge]
Give me all of you, oh
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you

[Outro]
I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh"
Got What I Got,Jason Aldean,"[Verse 1]

You're perfect for me
Everything I'll ever need
I ain't playin'
What I'm sayin'

[Chorus]
When I got what I got, I don't miss what I had
The old me before you belongs to the past
In the back of your mind, you might think there's somethin' more I want
But when I got what I got, girl, I don't

[Verse 2]
I said, ""Baby, do you know you sound a little crazy
When you're talkin' like that, girl?""
Ain't no second thoughts, no regrets, no kinda maybe
No wishin' I turned back
Before you came along
I could go all alone
Girl, just kiss me
You're all that I want

When I got what I got, I don't miss what I had
The old me before you belongs to the past

You know the song it's on repeat
Find your shoes, can't find your feet
Grab your wallet and your keys
Better not forget to breathe
Sweat until you're soaking
Don't let them see you choking
A teardrop in the sea
Tryna keep your head above water
You're tryna keep your head above water

There's an open door

Break My Heart,Dua Lipa,"[Verse 1]
I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?

[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me

You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me

Life Is Good (feat. Drake),Future,"[Перевод песни ""Future - Life Is Good (feat. Drake)""]

[Часть I]

[Припев: Drake]
Работаю на выходных, как обычно
Сторонюсь тусовок, как обычно
Ниггеры клянутся, что они превзошли нас, что они делают слишком круто
До сих пор плачу налоги за свои заскоки
Патеки от Вирджила на запястье - с ума сойти
Ниггеры спалили, как я поскользнулся - что теперь?
Кто-то разнес ваш район, я бы сказал, если бы это были мы
Люкс-номер в Rosewood, слишком роскошно

[Куплет: Drake]
Говоришь, что мои дни сочтены, но я продолжаю просыпаться
Знаю ты видишь мои сообщения, детка, пожалуйста, ответь что-нибудь
Вино в бокале, а твой парень — крохобор, ага?
Ниггеры свалят в день моего релиза, ага
Сука, это слава, а не власть
Я даже не понял, что это было, теперь пусть следят за языком
У малышки эго в два раза больше моей хаты
Не могу ей нагрубить, что есть, то есть (Что)
Сказал то, что должен был, и сделал то, что сделал (Эй)
Никогда не поворачиваюсь спиной к FBG, боже упаси
Патеки от Вирджила крутят сальто на запястье
Даю тебе свой номер, но не вздумай беспокоить по херне

[Припев: Drake]
Работаю на выходных, как обычно
Сторонюсь тусовок, как обычно (как обычно)
Ниггеры клянутся, что они превзошли нас, что они делают слишком круто
До сих пор плачу налоги за свои заскоки
Патеки от Вирджила на запястье - с ума сойти
Ниггеры спалили, как я поскользнулся - что теперь?

Мне было плохо в их окопах, приходилось ездить с этой палкой, у
Кто дал тебе таблетки? Кто дал тебе пыль? Pluto посылал тебя прилизаться, у
Слишком много осужденных колесят со мной, чтобы играть в твои игры, у
Не выношу херни, расстрелял суку, как Усаму, у
Теперь они поджигают свечки, нигга, любой может оказаться на его месте, у
Я на частном самолете поджигаю блант, Backwood полный дури, у
Пытаюсь провезти в Лондон Калаш с увеличенным, у
Они должны отпустить ниггу или мы сдохнем за него, у
Да, я езжу за своими ниггерами, я лгу своей сучке, у
Бедные ниггеры, теперь богатые ниггеры, мы сделали это, е
Я был в петле, щас пентхаус для шкафа, у
Как будто люстра на шее и на запястье, у
Мои белые девки говорят на разных языках, у

Я покажу твою физиономию в новостях, а пизду - на футболке после того, как замажу
А потом заставлю их подстрелить катафалк, это обойдется мне в четверть доллара, ниггер, оно того стоит
А ты маньяк, ебанный инопланетянин, как ты расплачиваешься?
У меня есть кошечка, я с ней развлекаюсь, идем в Birkin

Ride it, turn the lights down low
Ride it, from head to toe

Ride it, ride it, let me feel you

Won't you take me home? I wanna

Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?

Death By A Thousand Cuts (Live From Paris),Taylor Swift,"[Chorus]
Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
Get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Verse 1]
I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know""
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
So  if the story's over, why am I still writing pages?

[Chorus]
'Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
Get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Verse 2]
My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you too much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts

[Chorus]
Get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
No, it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Post-Chorus]
Part of me that you didn't touch
My body, my love, my trust
But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no

[Outro]
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know"""

Pomp and Circumstance,Sir Edward Elgar,"In Three Parts

During the time of the civil wars of York and Lancaster, England was a perfect bear-garden, and Shakespeare has given us a very lively picture of the scene. The three parts of HENRY VI convey a picture of very little else; and are inferior to the other historical plays. They have brilliant passages; but the general ground-work is comparatively poor and meagre, the style 'flat and unraised'. There are few lines like the following:

Glory is like a circle in the water;
Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself,
Till by broad spreading it disperse to naught.

The first part relates to the wars in France after the death of Henry V and the story of the Maid of Orleans. She is here almost as scurvily treated as in Voltaire's Pucelle. Talbot is a very magnificent sketch: there is something as formidable in this portrait of him, as there would be in a monumental figure of him or in the sight of the armour which he wore. The scene in which he visits the Countess of Auvergne, who seeks to entrap him, is a very spirited one, and his description of his own treatment while a prisoner to the French not less remarkable.

Salisbury. Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd.

Talbot. With scoffs and scorns, and contumelious taunts,
In open market-place produced they me,
To be a public spectacle to all.
Here, said they, is the terror of the French,
The scarecrow that affrights our children so.
Then broke I from the officers that led me,
And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground,
To hurl at the beholders of my shame.
My grisly countenance made others fly,
None durst come near for fear of sudden death.
In iron walls they deem'd me not secure:
So great a fear my name amongst them spread,
That they suppos'd I could rend bars of steel,
And spurn in pieces posts of adamant.
Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had:
They walk'd about me every minute-while;
And if I did but stir out of my bed,
Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.

The second part relates chiefly to the contests between the nobles during the minority of Henry and the death of Gloucester, the good Duke Humphrey. The character of Cardinal Beaufort is the most prominent in the group: the account of his death is one of our author's masterpieces. So is the speech of Gloucester to the nobles on the loss of the provinces of France by the king's marriage with Margaret of Anjou. The pretensions and growing ambition of the Duke of York, the father of Richard III, are also very ably developed. Among the episodes, the tragi-comedy of Jack Cade, and the detection of the impostor Simcox are truly edifying.

The third part describes Henry's loss of his crown: his death takes place in the last act, which is usually thrust into the common acting play of RICHARD III. The character of Gloucester, afterwards King Richard, is here very powerfully commenced, and his dangerous designs and long-reaching ambition are fully described in his soliloquy in the third act, beginning, 'Aye, Edward will use women honourably.' Henry VI is drawn as distinctly as his high-spirited Queen, and notwithstanding the very mean figure which Henry makes as a king, we still feel more respect for him than for his wife.

We have already observed that Shakespeare was scarcely more remarkable for the force and marked contrasts of his characters than for the truth and subtlety with which he has distinguished those which approached the nearest to each other. For instance, the soul of Othello is hardly more distinct from that of Iago than that of Desdemona is shown to be from Aemilia's; the ambition of Macbeth is as distinct from the ambition of Richard III as it is from the meekness of Duncan; the real madness of Lear is as different from the feigned madness of Edgar [Footnote: There is another instance of the name distinction in Hamlet and Ophelia. Hamlet's pretended madness would make a very good real madness in any other author.] as from the babbling of the fool; the contrast between wit and folly in Falstaff and Shallow is not more characteristic though more obvious than the gradations of folly, loquacious or reserved, in Shallow and Silence; and again, the gallantry of Prince Henry is as little confounded with that of Hotspur as with the cowardice of Falstaff, or as the sensual and philosophic cowardice of the Knight is with the pitiful and cringing cowardice of Parolles. All these several personages were as different in Shakespeare as they would have been in themselves: his imagination borrowed from the life, and every circumstance, object, motive, passion, operated there as it would in reality, and produced a world of men and women as distinct, as true and as various as those that exist in nature. The peculiar property of Shakespeare's imagination was this truth, accompanied with the unconsciousness of nature: indeed, imagination to be perfect must be unconscious, at least in production; for nature is so. We shall attempt one example more in the characters of Richard II and Henry VI.

The characters and situations of both these persons were so nearly alike, that they would have been completely confounded by a commonplace poet. Yet they are kept quite distinct in Shakespeare. Both were kings, and both unfortunate. Both lost their crowns owing to their mismanagement and imbecility; the one from a thoughtless, wilful abuse of power, the other from an indifference to it. The manner in which they bear their misfortunes corresponds exactly to the causes which led to them. The one is always lamenting the loss of his power which he has not the spirit to regain; the other seems only to regret that he had ever been king, and is glad to be rid of the power, with the trouble; the effeminacy of the one is that of a voluptuary, proud, revengeful, impatient of contradiction, and inconsolable in his misfortunes; the effeminacy of the other is that of an indolent, good-natured mind, naturally averse to the turmoils of ambition and the cares of greatness, and who wishes to pass his time in monkish indolence and contemplation.—Richard bewails the loss of the kingly power only as it was the means of gratifying his pride and luxury; Henry regards it only as a means of doing right, and is less desirous of the advantages to be derived from possessing it than afraid of exercising it wrong. In knighting a young soldier, he gives him ghostly advice—

Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight,
And learn this lesson, draw thy sword in right.

Richard II in the first speeches of the play betrays his real character. In the first alarm of his pride, on hearing of Bolingbroke's rebellion, before his presumption has met with any check, he exclaims:

Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords:
This earth shall have a feeling, and these stones
Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king
Shall falter under proud rebellious arms.
. . . . .
Not all the water in the rough rude sea
Can wash the balm from an anointed king;
The breath of worldly man cannot depose
The Deputy elected by the Lord.
For every man that Bolingbroke hath prest,
To lift sharp steel against our golden crown,
Heaven for his Richard hath in heavenly pay
A glorious angel; then if angels fight,
Weak men must fall; for Heaven still guards the right.

Yet, notwithstanding this royal confession of faith, on the very first news of actual disaster, all his conceit of himself as the peculiar favourite of Providence vanishes into air.

But now the blood of twenty thousand men
Did triumph in my face, and they are fled.
All souls that will be safe fly from my side;
For time hath set a blot upon my pride.

Immediately after, however, recollecting that 'cheap defence' of the divinity of kings which is to be found in opinion, he is for arming his name against his enemies.

Awake, thou coward Majesty, thou sleep'st;
Is not the King's name forty thousand names?
Arm, arm, my name: a puny subject strikes
At thy great glory.

King Henry does not make any such vapouring resistance to the loss of his crown, but lets it slip from off his head as a weight which he is neither able nor willing to bear; stands quietly by to see the issue of the contest for his kingdom, as if it were a game at push-pin, and is pleased when the odds prove against him.

When Richard first hears of the death of his favourites, Bushy, Bagot, and the rest, he indignantly rejects all idea of any further efforts, and only indulges in the extravagant impatience of his grief and his despair, in that fine speech which has been so often quoted:

Aumerle. Where is the duke my father, with his power?

K. Richard. No matter where: of comfort no man speak:
Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs,
Make dust our paper, and with rainy eyes
Write sorrow in the bosom of the earth!
Let's choose executors, and talk of wills:
And yet not so—for what can we bequeath,
Save our deposed bodies to the ground?
Our lands, our lives, and all are Bolingbroke's,
And nothing can we call our own but death,
And that small model of the barren earth,
Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
For heaven's sake let us sit upon the ground,
And tell sad stories of the death of Kings:
How some have been depos'd, some slain in war;
Some haunted by the ghosts they dispossess'd;
Some poison'd by their wives, some sleeping kili'd;
All murder'd:—for within the hollow crown,
That rounds the mortal temples of a king,
Keeps death his court: and there the antic sits,
Scoffing his state, and grinning at his pomp!
Allowing him a breath, a little scene
To monarchize, be fear'd, and kill with looks;
Infusing him with self and vain conceit—
As if this flesh, which walls about our life,
Were brass impregnable; and, humour'd thus,
Comes at the last, and, with a little pin,
Bores through his castle wall, and—farewell king!
Cover your heads, and mock not flesh and blood
With solemn reverence; throw away respect,
Tradition, form, and ceremonious duty,
For you have but mistook me all this while:
I live on bread like you, feel want, taste grief,
Need friends, like you; subjected thus,
How can you say to me I am a king?

There is as little sincerity afterwards in his affected resignation to his fate, as there is fortitude in this exaggerated picture of his misfortunes before they have happened.

When Northumberland comes back with the message from Bolingbroke, he exclaims, anticipating the result,—

What must the king do now? Must he submit?
The king shall do it: must he be depos'd?
The king shall be contented: must he lose
The name of king? O' God's name let it go.
I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,
My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,
My gay apparel for an almsman's gown,
My figur'd goblets for a dish of wood,
My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,
My subjects for a pair of carved saints,
And my large kingdom for a little grave—
A little, little grave, an obscure grave.

How differently is all this expressed in King Henry's soliloquy, during the battle with Edward's party:

This battle fares like to the morning's war,
When dying clouds contend with growing light,
What time the shepherd blowing of his nails,
Can neither call it perfect day or night.
Here on this mole-hill will I sit me down;
To whom God will, there be the victory!
For Margaret my Queen, and Clifford too,
Have chid me from the battle; swearing both
They prosper best of all when I am thence.
Would I were dead, if God's good will were so.
For what is in this world but grief and woe?
O God! methinks it were a happy life
To be no better than a homely swain,
To sit upon a hill as I do now,
To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,
Thereby to see the minutes how they run:
How many make the hour full complete,
How many hours bring about the day,
How many days will finish up the year,
How many years a mortal man may live.
When this is known, then to divide the times:
So many hours must I tend my flock,
So many hours must I take my rest,
So many hours must I contemplate,
So many hours must I sport myself;
So many days my ewes have been with young,
So many weeks ere the poor fools will yean,
So many months ere I shall shear the fleece:
So many minutes, hours, weeks, months, and years
Past over, to the end they were created,
Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.
Ah! what a life were this! how sweet, how lovely!
Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade
To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,
Than doth a rich embroidered canopy
To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?
O yes it doth, a thousand-fold it doth.
And to conclude, the shepherds' homely curds,
His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle,
His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,
All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,
Is far beyond a prince's delicates,
His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
His body couched in a curious bed,
When care, mistrust, and treasons wait on him.

This is a true and beautiful description of a naturally quiet and contented disposition, and not, like the former, the splenetic effusion of disappointed ambition.

In the last scene of RICHARD II his despair lends him courage: he beats the keeper, slays two of his assassins, and dies with imprecations in his mouth against Sir Pierce Exton, who 'had staggered his royal person'. Henry, when he is seized by the deer-stealers, only reads them a moral lecture on the duty of allegiance and the sanctity of an oath; and when stabbed by Gloucester in the Tower, reproaches him with his crimes, but pardons him his own death."
Daylight (Live From Paris),Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
But now I see daylight
I only see daylight

[Verse 2]
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
So I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things I'm never gonna say)
Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
But now I see daylight
I only see daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

[Bridge]
And I can still see it all in my mind
All of you, all of me intertwined
I once believed love would be black and white
But it's golden golden
And I can still see it all in my head
Back and forth from New York, sneaking in your bed
I once believed love would be burning red
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, like daylight

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things I'm never gonna say)
Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
But now I see daylight
I only see daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

[Outro]
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go"
God Whispered Your Name,Keith Urban,"[Verse 1]
I was so cold and lost
And nothing seemed to ring true
I couldn't bear the cross
For everything I'd been through
And each day, I knew I needed change
But there was no way, no way

[Chorus]
And then God whispered your name
And that's when everything changed
And love came out of the rain
And talk about being saved
Suddenly I wanna live
More than I ever did
I'm never gonna be the same
When God whispered your name

[Verse 2]
I can see the sunshine
For the first time in a while
Girl, it's like I've been baptized
By the warmth of your smile, hmm
Well, call it fate or faith or call it crazy either way
It's amazin', amazin' grace

[Chorus]
When God whispered your name
That's when everything changed
Love came out of the rain
Talk about being saved
Well, suddenly I wanna live
More than I ever did
I'm never gonna be the same
When God whispered your name

[Bridge]
It's just what I needed to hear, baby
It couldn't have been more loud and clear

[Chorus]
When God whispered your name
That's when everything changed
Love came out of the rain (Out of the rain)
And talk about being saved
Oh, suddenly I wanna live
More than I ever did
I'm never gonna be the same
When God whispered your name, oh yeah

[Outro]
(Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah)
Ooh, Hallelujah, baby
(Hallelujah) Oh, yeah, (Hallelujah) Hmm-hmm
(Hallelujah) Ooh yeah
I can see the sunlight shinin' through your pretty eyes, baby
(Hallelujah) Woo, hmm, (Hallelujah)
I like a man who leaves, time feels like Hell
(Hallelujah)
Got my hands up high, I got my hands up to the sky
(Hallelujah) Ooh, I'm sayin' thank you
(Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah)"

And I can swear they're speakin', speakin', speakin'
They're tellin' me to relax, I'm not good at that
But now, I know I need it, need it, need it (I slide)

[Pre-Chorus: Lennon Stella]
Ooh, now what you do? My tan lines tell the truth (I slide)
Yeah, on Venice beach, got sand all in my shoes (Tonight)
Ooh, unlock me loose, see the sunset from the roof (That's right)
Yeah, that crystal blue, and I came out someone new

[Chorus: Lennon Stella]
Hey, gettin' in my summer feelings
And I'm trying to keep it cool
Way up here in my summer feelings
And I found a piece of me that I never knew

[Verse 2: Charlie Puth]
You got my heart and I'm head over heels in love
In California, dreamin', dreamin', dreamin', yeah
Touchin' the stars and then draggin' them down to Earth
That California feelin', feelin', feelin' (I slide)

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Oh, now what you do? Your brown eyes tell the truth (I slide)
Yeah, down on the beach, I'm stayin' out late for you (Tonight)
Oh, unlock you loose, see the sunset from the roof (That's right)
Yeah, you're good to me, and I came out someone new

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Hey, gettin' in my summer feelings (Summer feelings)
And I, I'm trying to keep it cool
Way up here in my summer feelings
And I, I found a piece of me that I never knew

I'm meltin' like ice cream
The stress is gone for me
Nowhere I'd rather be (Oh)

[Chorus: Charlie Puth, Lennon Stella, Both]
Hey, gettin' in my summer feelings
And I, I'm trying to keep it cool
Way up here in my summer feelings
And I found a piece of me that I never knew
Hey, gettin' in my summer feelings
And I, I'm trying to keep it cool
Way up here in my summer feelings
And I found a piece of me that I never knew"

Just wanted you to know, you ain't alone
Keep a smile on your face, everything's gonna be fine
I love you

Let me go, I don't need you to wipe my tears
